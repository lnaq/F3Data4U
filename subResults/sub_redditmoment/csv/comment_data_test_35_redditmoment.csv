marshal_mellow,hjvh5ri,"cause they get married super young usually right before the dude ships off to the milllitary. So the marriage isn't really solid in the first place and then women get horny and lonely just like men do. 

Imagine you're the woman in the situation. 

Your bf wants to join the military and he wants to marry you 3 months before he ships out. If you turn him down and say you don't want to be with someone who is in the military people are going to act like you're a bad person for you know, wanting to have sex/spend time with your SO. So you marry the guy thinking its only a few years. Now all your friends are either single or married to men they actually come home to at night and you get lonely/horny. 

Ok, now its been 2 years. You're incredibly lonely and bored. You didn't think this through and you're regretting this marriage. 

Do you start divorce proceedings while your husband is in Afghanistan? Jesus imagine what people will say about you. Thats like up there with divorcing someone whos fighting cancer. So no, obviously you can't do that. The social stigma is too bad. So you cheat, cause he's in no position to catch you, and you can break off the cheating relationship before he gets back. Only by then you've barely seen him in years and dude is just some stranger you married at 18 years old.

How do any couples survive this? Is the better question if you ask me.

EDIT: Also this is america, our soldiers are super over glorified. To say ""We're breaking up if you enlist"" while IMO perfectly reasonable is GODDAMN COMMIE TALK that people are naturally going to gravitate away from.

EDIT2: To clarify for some now deleted comment

>If you turn him down and say you don't want to be with someone who is in the military people are going to act like you're a bad person for you know,

I am including *yourself* among people who will think you're a bad person. In america at least, we are socialized to see military service as perhaps the most noble thing you could do. To end a relationship over the logistics of having a partner whos deployed overseas would be seen like me forcing my gf to stop volunteering at a soup kitchen because I need her to make me dinner those nights. No one wants to feel that selfish, so even if you are thinking that it might be a deal breaker your brain is not programmed to allow that as an option. Especially when you consider that this is often a *young love* situation. The two of you will *make it work* just magically. Sure it goes badly all the time but those people just weren't *in love* like you two are. You wont end up like them.

aSharkNamedHummus,hjwp6n7,"Military culture (at least in the US) is very, very sexual. By that, of course I don’t mean officially, but more under the surface. All military branches are littered with men who, in their free time, seem to have nothing on their minds but sex and where to get it next. Listening in to some conversations in the male barracks is equal parts disgusting and horrifying. Not so much in female barracks, but I’m sure there are exceptions. Sexual assault is common in the US military, so there are *plenty* of military men who will take sex by force if they can get it, and I’d imagine even more who will sleep with a willing woman, whether she’s got a partner or not. 

The other factor I can think of is that you usually don’t shout it from the rooftops that you’ve got a partner before you cheat with someone. Most people are against cheating and don’t want to cause drama as a homewrecker, so they won’t go through with it if they know they’re enabling someone to cheat. In my opinion, the “homewrecker” is almost never to blame for a cheating situation because they just don’t know that there *is* a preexisting relationship.",3,Omg gib upvotes!!

Hodlin2gainz,hjxnjvn,"I’ve served, I am serving - I’ll try to keep this anonymish enough, or better yet this is all fiction, yeah anyone important looking at this, this is all made up. Totally. Don’t come after me. If you do though, I’m gonna fight you every step of the way cause you know this shit is how this shit is.

Here goes:

“Rushed” could cover most of it. The Military isn’t that often a first choice, it’s a backup one, and it is what you make of it. 

The service tends to bring people who have a certain air of desperation and lack of choices funneled into a high-stress competitive environment. Suddenly, you’re surrounded by fit people bonded by a shared sense of duty and purpose. Compared to most elements of civilian life, it’s hard to have that level of passion not to feel a bit sexy in a life-affirming way.

Also it seems that as history repeats itself and culture develops, the reputation and idea of something grows until it has almost a life of its own. The commenter is right, we even have a name for the cheater, Jody. Because it’s known, it’s always in the back of your mind, it can be almost a self fulfilling prophecy.

The worst I knew of was a man with 5 children, kind soldier, great leader, hard worker. Not a task went by him that he wasn’t out already doing before someone pointed out the lower-ranking of us should really go help him. He already had a federal job so on deployment between a wife and kids and continued federal pay, the money was being made hand over fist. Well they let a friend couch crash for a while during his deployment, and his wife called and told him she had slept with him. Last I knew they actually stayed together, but really what are you gonna do after 5 kids? The whole legal system really doesn’t have a way to account for that level of infidelity in a just way, it prioritizes kids first and mothers second, he’d never see them because they know we deploy, and he could just kiss every paycheck goodbye.

So there’s that element, relatively low risk if you’re the civilian married to the soldier. Now as a soldier on the other hand, you’re really on the hook, because adultery is a punishable offense under the military code of justice, but unfortunately, that’s a popularity contest at the end of the day. How so, why? I’ll tell ya.

I had another leader with two beautiful daughters and a wife, great in a one-on-one chat, but as soon as someone else was there he had to put on an air. Well he ended up getting a lower enlisted pregnant, which got her kicked off the deployment. Now if the lower enlisted doesn’t make an official report (which also kind of makes a command look bad because it shows a lack of discipline) then really there’s only one thing to do, and it’s probably the worst part about the military. How do you remove someone without any kind of reason? You promote to a new position. Yup, that’s right. If you’re a blame-dodging ninja and you can just matrix bullet scene /shaggy wasn-me your way through a situation, chances are you’re leveling up son (or daughter - don’t think for a minute this is a gendered problem, there’s just MORE men). It’s a real problem, but hey they’re out of that commands hair, and someone else’s issue.

Oh, and if you are NOT liked by the command, then you’re likely going to get a worse assignment, but most commanders don’t dislike you for cheating, they just look at it as something you have to deal with. I had a buddy who cheated, his wife and he had deployed together, on separate shifts cause you can’t have a couple on missions together, they slowly drifted apart and couldn’t save their marriage. He definitely cheated, and thought she might have, but she was gorgeous and everyone liked her, so when he was caught they made a big show of it, demoted him, gave him one of the punishment jobs to finish out his time.

Here’s another problem, there’s just a higher quality of man (in the traditional sense) to be found in the military, which tends to attract people that like tradition. Assume you’re a straight female, again, low life-options as we’ve discussed. Suddenly you go to a place where most men are very fit, workout all the time, great bodies, from every corner of America and it’s protectorates, the guys are decisive, tough, manly fighting men. It is what it is y’all, the bulk of the world just still likes certain things even if they go against modern sensibilities about how guys should be. And boy oh boy you young impressionable 18 year old girl, every single one of them has your attention. They call this situation while deployed, “princess for a year,” and it’s real. 

I was a celibate monk for my deployment because I really hate these kinds of games, which is why I’m speaking so plainly here, but I started having dreams about female soldiers that were outside my typical age and weight range after all that time. Your brain is literally that desirous of human comforts and there’s just no one else around.

So here you are as a young impressionable lady with literally your pick of the litter, and we all know if a woman wants sex she really doesn’t need to put *that much* effort into it, so there you go. A side problem with that tends to be sex work, which is a big no-no. There’s been several instances of duffel bags stacked with cash trying to be shipped back overseas by enterprising young ladies that get caught in the mail room.

There’s another problem which I continue to beat my chest about, because I’m a leader too and I want better things for those coming up, and that is that plainly speaking our sexual harassment program ignores a key element, that every single interaction is unequal due to our rank structure and the truly necessary emphasis on experience. 

So we need a level of experience because we have to know who is in charge if the leader dies. If I go down, the next nearest rank soldier has to get my Joes home. 

So anytime there’s an interaction, even if it’s two privates, our lowest rank, one always has more experience or time in grade, and a simple offer to go out for a drink isn’t just an invitation, it’s a request from a peer in a system that may ultimately result in you dying if you’re not conforming and complying properly, where you desperately NEED to fit in for your survival. Is the soldier thinking that? Of course not, but I can’t help but think an echo of that is in their head from the way we are trained.

We definitely teach that each soldier can say no, but I think they often gloss over how truly imbalanced this power arrangement is, and I tell you, it’s palpably weird.

When I first had females under my guidance, I understood what this was like, and I’ve often been the guy asking other men “do you not have sisters or a mother? Do you not know how to treat women close to you?” But even that doesn’t quite describe what it’s like. I’ll explain.

I’m probably an 8/10 on looks, traditional masculine features, wear the uniform nice, hit the gym more than morning PT so I’m in better shape than even most soldiers, get my haircut stylish as allowed, and I’ve been at this a while so I know what I’m about, I’m in my 30s. People treat you nicer when you’re nicer looking, it is what it is. I’m good at what I do, and there’s still much better men than me all over this military.

I’ll get soldiers in that are fresh out of basic, young and impressionable, and with what I do I’m often the first leader they get to work closely with, and I’m glad that I am.

When it’s a new female she’s often never worked with a guy like me - there’s a greater degree of separation in a training environment than in a working one, and with what we deal with, my word is God. I listen to them, genuinely care about them, train, guide, oversee, and if necessary have the authority to punish them. The power imbalance is HUGE. I get texts about their personal issues, I get sent pictures of what they’re doing, I get sent videos of their projects, their parties, holiday pictures, they want to share what they’re doing, I’m *supposed* to listen and care, and I do. I’m a grown-ass man with women that are still teens in regular contact, and that’s pretty different from most organizations. Do they low-key flirt with you or send pretty clearly skirt-the-edge of proper texts? Absolutely. I once had one asking about my spouse, who the said “well X is *sure* lucky to have a guy like you…” and I said “thanks!” And walked away a before I registered what she had been meaning. Turns out she was known to go after married men. 

To me, that’s all the more reason to look out for them and yourself, but to someone of lesser ethics that wasn’t aware of the social and professional dynamics of what they have here, it can be a problem. I’ve seen leaders misunderstand the attention (because most men just never get that at all) and then boom, they’re making career changing or ending mistakes.

We wouldn’t have that meme of the titanic approaching the iceberg that reads something like “Married E-6 with dependents” on the ship and “brand new female PFC” as the iceberg for just no reason.

Plus that plays into a certain kind of fantasy, you’re just a young lady soldier right out of training and suddenly the older but not too old military man that’s the boss of your world is falling for you? Get outta here. It happens all the time though, and many abuse the whole situation.",0,Omg gib upvotes!!

EtruscanKing023,hjtater,"I don't think it is. IIRC this is the same guy who wore a WW1 German uniform to his school and then said people called him a Nazi. IMO he was intentionally trying to bait people into thinking that so he could have a gotcha moment, but again that's just IMO.

If that *is* what he was going for, then it's also not that much of a gotcha moment anyway, since:

1. The German Empire, while nowhere near as bad as the Nazis, wasn't exactly spotless itself. Imperial Germany showcased it's own brutality plenty of times, see the Herero and Namaqua genocide, Kaiser Wilhelm II's speech about the Boxer Rebellion or their invasion of Belgium in 1914.

2. The flag of the German Empire is still usually used as a far right symbol, just one that allows for the semi-plausible deniability that a swastika doesn't. Especially applicable in Germany, where, AFAIK, it's illegal to use a swastika for things like that.
