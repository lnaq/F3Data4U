lightgiver,ftaj78k,Flat Earthers don't really deny how big the Earth is. So it's actually very easy to use trig to prove the distance to the sun is much farther than flat Earthers say it is. Using their own estimates for distance the sun would be 4x farther away at sunrise/sunset than noon. Also the light would be 16x dimmer because light fades at a square root. Something they can test themselves with a flashlight. However the sun looks larger at sunrise/sunset. So simple observation contradicts their estimates so much it's obvious even without measurements. The only way to fix this is to have the sun way further out and way bigger. That way it looks nearly the same distance away at the horizon or directly above. However if the earth was flat you then all of the Earth is ether in daytime or night time. Something that is easy to prove is not the case.,4,A short story,rextraneous,/r/memes/comments/gyfedz/a_short_story/ftaj78k/,0.052,0.017,0.932,0.689

,gl8565q,"Explanation

You have candy. I ask to borrow that candy. I sell that candy to my friend. I hope the price will go down so I can buy back that candy, give you your candy back, and pocket the difference.

But the price didnt go down and my friend doesn't want to sell me the candy back. Well now I gotta go to the store to buy candy to give to you. But all the stores are sold out because everyone loves candy.

You are very angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter what the cost. So I pay lots of money for super expensive candy that nobody else buys.

Now I'm very sad cause I have no candy and I have no money :(

Im Melvin Capital, the candy is GameStop, and everyone buying candy is Reddit.

**Explanation for the newcomers**

You   have candy. I ask to borrow that candy. I sell that candy to my  friend.  I hope the price will go down so I can buy back that candy,  give you  your candy back, and pocket the difference.

But   the price didnt go down and my friend doesn't want to sell me the  candy  back. Well now I gotta go to the store to buy candy to give to  you. But  all the stores are sold out because everyone loves candy.

You   are big angry at me and demand I get you the candy back, no matter  what  the cost. So I pay big big dollars for super unavailable candy.

Now I'm very sad cause I have no candy and I have no money :(

My anthropology/archaeology professor is an expert on the Maya culture and is fluent in the language. He debunked this during the first day of class, though he spoke some of the language for us.

His job entails going on expeditions to sites in Central and South America during the summer. He has even discovered some Maya stelae and done writing for scientific journals.

[John Major Jenkins] (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Major_Jenkins) was the pseudoscience writer who popularized the idea of the Maya Doomsday Calendar.

IKnowGuacIsExtraLady,gb8nuli,"The reason is because that was how the system was started hundreds of years ago and for any one state to change it they would essentially weaken themselves. For example if you live in a state that votes 60% blue and 40% red what would make sense is 60% of the vote to go blue and 40% red. However, if your state decides to change their rules to do that and the other states don't then you as a majority blue state are essentially just giving power over to red which is not in the interest of the majority of your voters so they are never going to agree to do that.

Changing the system would only work if every state agrees to do it at once but that is a nightmare to try and get done because the current system gives extra power to small states who obviously don't want to give up said power.

if you use the gi bill for 4 years of a grad school (MBA + JD for example) you can get close to $400,000 in payouts (Tuition 60k a year + housing allowance + stipends). i know a guy who did that - 28 years old, got to live in germany a few years, earned a masters in business, law degree and no debt.

Covering a short requires you to buy the stock, which drives the price up even more. Which is exactly what happened. Most of these shorts positions still haven't been covered, that's why people are still buying.

What IS manipulation, is preventing retail investors from buying the stock and only allowing them to sell, which benefits the hedge funds. Meanwhile, the hedge funds are free to trade as they please. This is what many brokers did and that's why the price decreased below 300 USD yesterday.

TittleLits,gl7zyg0,"The hedge fund doesn't think the stock is too cheap, it thinks it's too expensive.

The idea is this:

1. ""borrow"" a share that is worth 50 dollars now and promise to give it back in a year.
2. Sell this share now for 50 dollars
3. Buy the same share for cheaper than 50 dollars between now and a year
4. Give the share back to the person you 'borrowed'it from
5. Your profit is the difference between the 50 dollars you've sold it for and the lower price that you've paid for it.

Now it's hopefully easy to see that when this stock doesn't go below 50 dollars there is no profit to be had, only losses",2,What a shame,justlooking033,/r/memes/comments/l7hah3/what_a_shame/gl7zyg0/,0.16,0.054,0.786,0.9099

Timageness,f1j9wsi,"Believe it or not, there might actually be some scientific basis for that.

It essentially boils down to more advanced creatures needing more efficient forms of energy consumption. A cow, for example, survives by eating grass all day, since they possess a simpler animal mindset. However, a human being wouldn't be able to use that method effectively, as the amount of time it would take to consume said grass exceeds the singular day it would power us for, so we eat the cow instead, as they've already farmed up all of that energy for us and stored it away in their meat.

So assuming that an alien civilization with lightspeed capabilities or greater were to visit Earth, they'd likely need to consume a rather large amount of energy to keep *themselves* going, and by that logic, well... let's just say that the cow's probably not going to cut it for them.",20,Simpsons predicted it yet again,heycanwedie,/r/memes/comments/d9gvok/simpsons_predicted_it_yet_again/f1j9wsi/,0.129,0.0,0.871,0.9517

Of note, in ""Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack"" they even mention a slimmer Godzilla-like monster attacking New York during the movie, but all of the main characters immediately dismiss it and state it couldn't be Godzilla.

That being said, after the American copyright ran out for that IP the Japanese owners of the franchise brought the slimmer American Godzilla back as an enemy monster simply called ""Zilla"" for a few short scenes.

The slender raptor like design is exclusive to that incarnation of Godzilla. The film itself is frequently criticized by fans due to the changes to Godzilla as a character and the idea that a human pregnancy test would work for a giant lizard. 

 It's definitely a fun entry to the series though but I'm sure many people consider it to be non-cannon.

If started out innocent enough. Your usual water base, then some dirt and flour, maybe a few actual flowers as well.

Then came the brainwave. The element that would truly complete the potion.

My sister asked for the potion and peed into it (we were very young at this point, mind you).

We were so proud that we took it to school the next day.

It. Fucking. Reeked.

It was so gross, that people were coming over to inspect what the commotion was. My mother, who worked at the school as a teacher, caught on to this pretty fast and had us throw it away (party pooper mum).

Later that day, after the piss potion had been roasting in the outdoor bin under direct sunlight, the bin itself was almost impossible to see through the hundreds, if not thousands of flies that were swarming to that delicious sewerage bouquet.

A degree shows that you can do the ""basic"" stuff in your industry. Not saying that a Master's Degree in Engineering is basic, but relative to a specific sector and/or specialization, it is. You still have **a lot** to learn. Complete university shows that you have the strength and willpower to go through a challenging and sometimes tedious work. You can also indicate that having experience from a similar position, and many companies acknowledge that. My good friend has no degree and has worked his way up, and a lot of my colleagues are without degrees. It's just two ways to get to the same spot. 

But with that said, don't expect getting hired for a position without experience or a degree, even though the job doesn't use everything taught in school :)

I was not smart enough to do this in freshman undergrad and once like 12 people submitted my matlab code for a class. The TA for the class was livid.

develo,fxy98if,"I was curious so I decided to do the math. All these calculations are based on a Glock 17. The muzzle speed of a Glock 17 is 375 m/s, and a 9mm bullet weighs 7.0 to 8.3 grams (I'll use 8.3 to give the Glock as much recoil as possible). That means the momentum of the bullet will be 3.1125 kg m/s. Since momentum is conserved, all of that should transfer in the opposite direction to the gun, spacesuit, and astronaut. An average human has a mass of 62 kg (seems low to me, but a larger mass is going to reduce the speed further). As for the mass of a space suit, I've found a lot of conflicting answers so I'll use 127 kg which is what NASA says. So dividing the momentum by the combined mass of our astronaut and space suit gives us a speed of...

0.0165 m/s, 0.0594 km/h, or 0.0369 mph. In other words, you're not going to die. You're going to barely move.",2,Always has been,imaduco,/r/memes/comments/hqeip1/always_has_been/fxy98if/,0.033,0.038,0.928,0.0178
