So why do they ask questions about us when we really are using the correct bathroom for our gender when we say nothing to them the fact is it's a bathroom it has one meaning small to others big to us other people can't really understand I think that's most of the problem any thoughts????,-25,"I wish I was kidding, but I‚Äôm not.

Somanypaswords4,hjwkqr8,"I have no problem with this. Just stay out of my dressing room, whomever you are, and this is simply not a problem. 

Dressing rooms and locker rooms should be private. I don't want to see your junk, end of story.

Here is a simple question for people- is it important to tell your life partner that you have or are changing gender or anatomy? If you honestly think it's not relevant to mention, then what is?

Society is biologically infatuated with sex and gender, but not accepting of dishonesty.

It's illogical to say a trans+X = X, unless, trans = nil or 0. Obviously that is not true.

So think about it in another perspective. Tomatoes are a fruit, by plant definition, but a vegetable by cooking, and commonly considered a vegetable because of the culinary use, not biological. The definition of tomato changes based on the usage. Competing definitions are reduced to common usage.

If you tell your doctor you are X, or, X-to-Y, or, Y which one is going to be relevant to how you are defined by the medical definition? Because saying Y when you are X is not the same as saying X-to-Y. The definition of X or Y changes on the usage.

Competing definitions of X or Y while ignoring X-to-Y is absurd in terms of acceptable definitions, like ignoring a tomato is both a fruit and a vegetable. Either way, X or Y or whatever comes from a person, just as a tomato comes from a plant.

The acceptance of these terms is playing out in public. But I still can't figure out how anyone thinks it's ok to be showing or staring at your fruit and veggies to anyone not intimately understanding your X or Y, locker rooms or anywhere.

People need to accept ladyboys like they do in other cultures. Gender is not binary, just like tomatoes. Request a locker room for trans and nb, and your problem is solved, no?",-27,"I wish I was kidding, but I‚Äôm not.

kaisklutz,hjvetc1,"It seems impossible, but there are homophobic and transphobic people in theater/drama/choir. 

In 8th grade, right after I came out as trans (to my family, I wasn't out at school whatsoever) this girl I'd known for a year started mocking a boy for ""walking gay"" in the lunch room. I stood up from the table and walked away, and I didn't talk to her after that. I found out later in drama from some other LGBT+ kids that she had a reputation of being kind of a bitch.

A girl I met the next year (at a different school), I think she was lowkey transphobic. Like transphobic.... but lowkey about it. 

Once she asked if I was trans and when I said yes, started using she/her pronouns for me. I thought it was mistake, like maybe she thought I was MtF, but now I'm not so sure. I went to her house once, and later she told me that her parents ""usually didn't like trans people"", and made it sound like she was congratulating me for not being annoying or talking about being trans.

Kinda made me glad that I took all their reese's.",129,"I wish I was kidding, but I‚Äôm not.

this was in the mid-2000s so we did not have the same level of representation or awareness. AFAB wasn‚Äôt a known phrase. Transgender was just barely beginning to replace transsexual.

If I was back in high school this would have made me feel so bad and ostracized, I would have avoided the room all together.

Thick_Confidence_502,hjvw5nz,No it isn't male us a gender female is a gender and transgender is a gender men and women don't change together in public the change with the same gender that means that transgenders should change with other transgenders plus this is a highschool everybody knows how kids are if she just walks on into the female changing room then other kids might recognize them and bully her and sure she could tell but from my experience in public school whenever you told the teacher shit just got worse and after high school comes the real world ain't no more bullies there call criminals and they don't calm you names they assault you it's best to prevent shit like that from happening by just giving them there own place where they can feel safe and don't even have to worry about shit like that,-24,"I wish I was kidding, but I‚Äôm not.

Religion is a touchy subject, but I knew lots of Christian kids growing up that would act similarly. Like, these kids would be nice and friendly bc the 2nd main tenant of Christianity is that your supposed to love others and they genuinely did.

But then they would say some of the most bigoted shit because they were just repeating what they're parents had taught them without thinking it through.

plasticpole,hjyv2ri,"Thanks for asking this question; I think that many people come to this sub and those like it with questions like this - I myself lurked here for ages before I felt comfortable in contributing - albeit minimally! Threads like these really helped me come to terms with who I am and led me to a place where I am much more comfortable, and sometimes even proud of my identity. I love that we all come from a different place, but this doesn't mean that we are any more or less valid. We are human and with that comes all the differences and variables that brings.

As for my story, was I aware that something was different? Yes and no. I was always drawn to feminity, despite outwardly, desparately trying to 'be a man'. I cross-dressed for as long as I can remember; but for years struggled with the question of what that meant. It took a while, but now I'm here. Oddly, it was coming out to a colleague that made me really and truely feel that this is who I am. saying it out loud felt right and accurate.

Lady_of_the_Seraphim,hjz8d0k,"The problem is that most people over the age fo twenty didn't know what the term ""transgender"" meant when they were little. That or they were exposed to a very negative definition of it.

When people say ""I've known since I was little"" chances are the majority of the time they aren't talking about being consciously aware of being trans since they were young. They're talking about knowing something was wrong and in hindsight being able say ""those were signs that I was trans"".

For instance, I hated getting my picture taken when I was little. For a chunk of time I wore a swim shirt cause I didn't like being barechested in public. I was often jealous of the girls toy's my parents would buy for my sister. I hated getting haircuts, I didn't like having short hair. The boys lockerroom was the most uncomfortable place in the world for me and I often changed in a stall. When I was like ten my sister had this really pretty floral dress that I used to love trying on.

Obviously in hindsight all of those are signs that I was trans and using those as examples I could easily say ""I've always sorta known."" It doesn't mean I was aware of being trans at that age, cause trust me, I wish I had been and could have transitioned prior to puberty. But it does mean there were signs that I didn't know what they meant until much later.

I didn't know something was off with my birth gender since I was little but I knew something was off with me. I was often very uncomfortable doing normal things. But I figured since I didn't know anything else that that was normal foe everyone so it didn't mean anything.

ThePaigeEdict,hjvswun,"Most definitely! In fact you can change as much as you want too. I remember in the beginning for me when I came out as trans I told myself if I was gonna go through with it I would go all the way even with genital surgery. Not because I wanted to but because I felt I had to.

This was also a case for me with training my voice, getting breast implants, bottom surgery etc etc. Eventually I realized that I don't care what genitals I had, or getting implants because I just wanted a size that will fit me, and to myself I sound the way I want to sound so why would I force myself to change those things.

Of course this is not the case for everyone. But, for some people just being able to dress like a woman is enough. For me its dressing like a woman and going through HRT.

So do whatever your comfortable with and whatever you feel will make you the most happy.",2,If you're a trans woman is it okay to want to keep pre-op genitals and not feel dysmorphia around it and still want to look like a woman and be a woman?

seifer48,hjvwbve,"Dysmorphia is a mental illness that causes the afflicted to obsessively focus on a perceived flaw in their appearance, minor or imagined.   Dysphoria is generally what trans people have and from what we know is a physiological condition due to brain and body incongruency. You don't necessarily need dysphoria to be transgender. Dysmorphia can apply to anyone and can be treated with therapy. The only treatment that works for gender dysphoria is transition.  You can't change a person's brain without fundamentally completely changing who they are. Conversion therapy has never worked to cure transgender people, just like you can't turn a cis person into a trans person.",5,If you're a trans woman is it okay to want to keep pre-op genitals and not feel dysmorphia around it and still want to look like a woman and be a woman?

sometimes_steph_,hjxnivi,"I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to directly answer your question, but one of the things that I‚Äôve been doing quite regularly for the past 8 months is finding transgender people on Instagram and YouTube and listening to their experiences as a means to build a framework for understand what I am feeling and how I perceive myself. One caveat is that Instagram and YouTube typically have younger people on there so there‚Äôs not as much representation (from what I can tell) for older transgender people. That being said, they do exist and their experiences are valid. I‚Äôve tried to listen to people who are around my age (early to mid thirties). 

I think it‚Äôs also worth reading as much as you can about the transgender community from different sources too. I don‚Äôt have anything really recent, but Julia Serano‚Äôs Whipping Girl is what I would recommend to anyone wanting to put language to transgender experience. I won‚Äôt say that it‚Äôs a definitive piece of work because I‚Äôm not as well read as I would like to be but I think it‚Äôs a very good start. 

I have one last comment and it‚Äôs about myself. I tend to feel that I am transgender and I lean towards the trans-femme side of things but may be non-binary. I don‚Äôt really ‚Äúfeel like a woman in a mans body‚Äù and one point Serano‚Äôs Whipping Girl makes is that the narrative is one way to present transgender expression in a conformative way for cishet people.

ElianFinn,hjz6ktp,I never felt that stereotypical trans ‚Äúclich√© phrase‚Äù but i know that I am a man and after having top surgery and being on T for several years I‚Äôm actually comfortable in my skin. I would describe the feelings I had more of never feeling like I quite fit myself no matter who I was. I tried everything and nothing was right and I hated my body so much. And one day it just kind of clicked in my head that ‚Äúoh can you be made accidentally wrong??‚Äù And so I started wearing mens clothes and I actually felt comfortable with myself and when people address me by my name and male pronouns it doesn‚Äôt make my heart hurt hearing it. I think the feeling is less of ‚Äúbeing in the wrong body‚Äù and more of accepting the person I was always born to be. Sometimes now that I feel very comfortable with myself I will wear more typically ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù clothes because I don‚Äôt really believe that clothes have a gender. Whatever I identify as on the inside is who I am and what people judge me as on the outside is up to them.

Well, I don't mind them in that context either.

It's less about sexual and dysphoric issues than it is I just dislike the inconveniences of pain-sensitive external sex organs without the benefit of peeing standing up.

MoeGhostAo,hjxwbic,"I want to pass because to me, that would be the ultimate relief from my dysphoria. Wouldn‚Äôt make it go away, but it would help so much. 

I also like many traditionally feminine aesthetics, they make me feel happy.

What‚Äôs toxic isn‚Äôt the idea of passing, but the *expectation* of passing as mandatory or what makes you female or male, depending on your transition. 

Gender *roles* are bad IMO. You shouldn‚Äôt be forced into a role based on your gender or ability to pass. Your treatment shouldn‚Äôt hinge on adherence to these things either. No two people are alike, they shouldn‚Äôt be expected to have the same way of expressing themselves.

THAT BEING SAID, passing can be how you personally want to express your gender, a means to help with dysphoria, a source of euphoria, or all of the above.

It can also be a source of safety if you live in a place where visibly nonconforming people are mistreated.

It‚Äôs a personal decision, the problem is when others are judged or shamed for deciding differently.",9,isn‚Äôt the ‚Äúpassing‚Äù thing reinforcing gender roles?,laralovesyou,/r/trans/comments/qq3v93/isnt_the_passing_thing_reinforcing_gender_roles/hjxwbic/,0.159,0.093,0.747,0.9022

First of all, stereotypes are not the problem and they are something that cannot be abolished - there will always be something that will prevail as typical and thus as a stereotype.

Orienting yourself to this typical one is a great help if you want to be perceived differently - not only after you have spoken, but at first sight.

Stereotypes only become a problem when they become a compulsion or requirement. You must(!) have long hair to be a girl, you must(!) be muscular to be a man.

I went to visit a friend recently to come out to her. I didn‚Äôt want her to open the door and ‚Äúta-da!‚Äù, see that I‚Äôm a woman without a proper conversation first. So I toned it down dressing andro and for the first 15 minutes she was totally oblivious to the fact dead-naming and dead-pronouning me while a bit distracted dealing with her 4 year old. 

Then her 4 year old suddenly interrupts her mom, looks at her seriously in the eye and asks ‚Äúmom, why do you keep treating her like a boy if she‚Äôs a girl?‚Äù. My friend then starts to automatically correct her, embarrassed, while I try to interrupt calling out to her until I get her attention. I look at here and tell her ‚Äú[friend name], I‚Äôm trans‚Äù. Her face just blanks out while her head spins a little, then she just turns around and responds to her kid ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry [daughter‚Äôs name], you‚Äôre right and mommy just made a mistake, she‚Äôs obviously a girl‚Äù. üíú",126,"Before I came out my older sister was a nanny and was introducing one of the kids to me.
