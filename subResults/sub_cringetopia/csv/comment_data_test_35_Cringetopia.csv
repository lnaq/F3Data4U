uslashuname,hjy7e37,"Way before the before times, I worked at this place which had a tree in the parking lot (not in a planter box they just didn‚Äôt pave too close around it). To accommodate this the line painters, when they got to where a full space wouldn‚Äôt fit, they just skipped to the other side of the tree. Best spot in the place, you could park with your hood up by the tree and you knew the tree would make sure nobody parked so close your door would be blocked. Bitch backed in to the spot, which I later measured at over 11 feet wide not counting the tree, and ended up not inside the lines by the full width of her tires.

I get to work and like usual parking in the employee area is at a premium as you might expect when some place expands the building but doesn‚Äôt expand employee parking. Driving a nimble little car and not minding a tight squeeze to get in and out of my car, I took the spot she had invaded. I took a couple photos too.

She told anyone that would listen that she had to climb in through her passenger seat. Eventually it came around to me and I pulled up the photos, and news of which parking space she was in and how bad of a driver she must be to create this situation spread of its own (I only showed the photos to my boss but he had to explain to the other departments why he wasn‚Äôt going to punish me and once half of management knew it was bound to get out since the ‚Äúvictim‚Äù had been so loud when she thought no evidence existed.",46,Fat Man thinks its okay to ruin someone's car although it's in the lines,combatcompanion,/r/Cringetopia/comments/qq1l2l/fat_man_thinks_its_okay_to_ruin_someones_car/hjy7e37/,0.051,0.052,0.897,-0.6705

ItsATerribleLife,hjy2v9k,"Pro-Tip.

If you have a dollar tree with a grocery near you (not all dollar trees have food), you can get staples like rice and dried beans for a dollar per 1-2 pounds depending on what brand they have stocked. same with dried Pasta. 

Just make sure to spread them out on a pan to pick out any rocks or broken beans. Which you'd have to do regardless where you buy them, but it does seem there is slightly higher frequency in the cheap packs at dollar tree. 

Rice, dried beans and pasta arent much in and of themselves, but they can make the more expensive things you have to buy elsewhere stretch much farther than normal.. and you can more readily afford them by saving the money buying some of your things at dollar tree.

Just dont buy canned goods.

Karnaje,hjxrguw,"The show is a representation of inequalities between lower and higher social classes as well as a denounciation of sexism to some extent (for instance with a domestic violence scene that ends up in revenge).

Not only that but in this show, the only characters that are introduced in a bad way and that we tend to dislike are male (all bad guys are men in this series... literally all). Contrary to this, on the few characters that we actually cared about because of their backstory, their character development and the way they are portrayed, most were women and that's pretty much the reason why the north korean one is the favorite of many people.

Finally, I disagree with the article content when they say that they do not reallt know what to do with their women characters. Have they watched the show ? How didn't they notice how lazy the characters development of male was compared to female ones that is much more nuanced ? Basically male in this show are only a fonction : the bad guy (could have been interesting but they rushed it), the kind guy, the hero... they all stay pretty much the same and/or evolved in a really predictable way. Kang Sae Byok is better written than this, so is Kang Sae Byok's friend. Ofc the show is not that well written overall so it is debatable, but I would not really say that they had a better idea of what to do with male characters... a part for the main protagonist whose destiny was easy to guess.",12,"It's a god damn TV series, grow up",rusty_trombone86,/r/Cringetopia/comments/qq2rwr/its_a_god_damn_tv_series_grow_up/hjxrguw/,0.146,0.102,0.752,0.9534

justmerriwether,hjwguid,"The funniest thing about all these people getting butthurt about people ‚Äúscreenshooting their NFT‚Äù is that they *own* an NFT and fundamentally misunderstand what it is they own, because the art is *not* the NFT and an NFT is *not* art. 

An NFT is a unique hyperlink containing a unique string of random data that represents a value equal to what people are willing to pay for it, depending on various factors like if it was previously owned by someone incredibly noteworthy or famous or if it comes with other benefits, such as owning one of one thousand NFTs issued by Buffalo Wild Wings that grants you one free basket of wings a day as long as you own it.

The GIFs and little images that people keep saying are their NFTs are the randomly picked destination that their hyperlink of random, unique data takes them to if they enter the link into a web browser. That‚Äôs it. It can be literally anything, can actually change at any time, and has no significance unless, for instance, the value is that a famous artist made it, in which case the value is in owning the original. So it‚Äôs as idiotic to be mad that people are screenshotting it as it is for the Louvre to be upset that people own duplications and prints of the Mona Lisa.

But also not even really, because you don‚Äôt own the art. You own the link.",16,Delete that screenshot,Ok_Salt_2441,/r/Cringetopia/comments/qpsk0a/delete_that_screenshot/hjwguid/,0.064,0.042,0.894,0.544

jcm2606,hjxg8a6,"Basically, it's a token (a virtual object that exists within a particular cryptocurrency ecosystem, such as Ethereum's ERC-20 tokens which are behind coins like ShibaInu/SHIB) that is designed to be uniquely identifiable, so that it's unlike any other token of the same type.

The idea of it is that when you purchase or receive some NFT, you own *that* particular NFT, and even if someone else owns their own NFT, your NFT is distinctly different to their's. Your NFT is unique, and is different to everyone else's.

People have taken this and basically applied it to digital art (a picture, a video clip, some text, etc), where the NFT represents ownership of that digital art, basically turning it into a collectible of sorts. Think collectible Pokemon cards, except digital.

The problem? They're digital, they're susceptible to copying. Anybody can simply copy the digital art, so despite the fact that the NFT represents your ownership of that digital art, it's basically meaningless because the digital art itself isn't tied to the NFT, anybody can view it online and get the link to the art piece like it were any other piece of art, *because it is.*

Hence, right now, NFTs are basically just used by idiots who want to spend insane amounts of money for a token that represents ownership of some digital art piece, rather than the art piece in itself. NFTs in themselves have many nifty applications (would be cool if they could be legally bound to some contract or deed, so that you have verifiable and legally valid proof via the blockchain of your ownership over some physical item), but this one particular application that people are (ab)using them for is moronic.",2,Delete that screenshot,Ok_Salt_2441,/r/Cringetopia/comments/qpsk0a/delete_that_screenshot/hjxg8a6/,0.036,0.036,0.928,-0.631

Look at the Chia blockchain pooling protocol. It uses NFTs to marry plots (hard drive equvilent of a small GPU) to the pool you are a part of.
