NoSuchKotH,hjz7rz6,"No, nothing fancy like that. I'm still new at this math game ;-)

We engineers often deal with power limited instead of energy limited signals, I.e. signals that are not in L2. Yet we treat power limited signals just like we would treat energy limited signals and take their Fourier transform. The better texts admit that they artificially limit the signals to have bounded support, thus forcing them into L2, which of course then is different from the infinite length(support) signals we usually talk about. But worse, most texts just ignore that the Fourier transform would be infinite everywhere for infinite length, power limited signals and all the problems this brings with it, pretending that the Fourier transform magically works and does its thing.

I stumbled over this when I tried to correctly model 1/f noise and the ""usual"" formulas would lead to contradictory results.

trinarynimbus,hjwf5q8,"Well, mathematics started this way. The ancients weren't given formulae on stone tablets; mathematics had to evolve, and encountered a lot of trouble along the way, so it wasn't really until the 19th century formalization programme that we established modern notions of rigor.

I don't see ""just rely on the formulas"" as really doing mathematics at all. That's like saying that driving a car is the same as being a mechanical engineer. The formulae were derived by people proving stuff. So, when I'm teaching mathematics, I don't just give formulae to rote-learn, I instead show why something is true and encourage the students to also be able to re-derive it from scratch, in case they get to the exam and forget.

At the start of every semester, the advice I give my students is to break mathematical concepts up into three types: *Definitions*, *Theorems* and *Algorithms*. They each require a different learning approach:

* *Memorize* definitions
* *Prove* theorems (even if it's an established theorem, try re-proving it yourself from scratch.)
* *Practice* algorithms.

And it should be done in that order. You can't prove a theorem until you grok the definitions you're doing a proof about; and there is no point practicing an algorithm if you don't know the theorems which it is based on.

It is easy to observe that when someone tries to do things out of order, such as by skipping theorems and jumping straight to algorithms, they inevitably find mathematics a lot more difficult.

The person who groks the theorems because they tried proving it themselves can easily see how the algorithm works and re-invent it if required. Whereas, the person who merely focuses on memorizing algorithmic techniques will always feel one step behind, and anything they do learn is easily replaced by a computer program.",85,Doing math organically,Kommienezuspadt_,/r/math/comments/qpvwq5/doing_math_organically/hjwf5q8/,0.064,0.03,0.906,0.866
DM_ME_YOUR_INTEGRALS,hjwg5tj,"Hmm... I think as long as you arrive at a conclusion by using knowledge already available to you, without someone ""just telling you the answer / how it's to be done"" then it is 'organic'.

Ideally, a student will learn everything in this manner. I believe the reason student's *don't* do that 100% is because of resources, a big one being time. Being tested and doing a course at a fast pace are barriers to this 'organic' process of discovery. It is up to the student in most cases to make that one-on-one instruction part of their learning (e.g., I have students who don't come to my office hours at all). I said ideally, but who knows, maybe there is a better balance to strike between two of these extremes.

For your research: your feelings / sentiments are valid. Remember, we *all* stand upon the shoulders of many, and soon more upon ours. My two cents are the same as in my 1st paragraph.

Yagloe,hjxeglf,"Okay, so there is a lot of work in math pedagogy on problem solving approaches to math instruction.  They rest on, essentially, the same observation you made about your partner: when people understand the problem context they are generally able to generate solutions. I've seen second graders solve problems you would probably model as two equations with two unknowns by drawing and using colored blocks. One of the problems we have found in research on math teaching and learning is that students are rushed into reliance on standard algorithms waaaay too quickly and don't spend enough time in problem-solving mode to be able to understand (a) how the algorithm works or (b) what the equation means. Instead most just try to memorize and hope for the best. Many end up 'hating math' and conveying their 'math-phobia' to their kids.

Even if you fail, you learn from it and try again. But in the second mindset you are focused on what could go wrong and feel hopeless and paralyzed.

Kreizhn,hjxftwz,">Though I do teach the ""why"" behind concepts in class, maybe the problem lies in the stuff that comes after the lesson. When my students are doing problems, they get lost in how to solve them at times because mostly they don't know how to fit the problem into the corresponding formula. Maybe this comes from over-emphasizing the formulaic part of the lecture?

This would certainly be an argument for flipping your classroom, even if it's only for this portion of the syllabus.

But without touching on the ""organic"" portion, I've seen a similar issue when I teach financial mathematics. Even with a great emphasis on the derivation of the formulas and problems spent modifying the scenario so that new formulas need to be invented, I would often see students trying to ""cram"" a problem into a formula. A large reason for this is the terrible mathematics education our students receive in most high schools, *where this is exactly what they're taught to do*.

I've now made the financial mathematics portion of that course almost completely abstract and it's done wonders. For example, with compounding interest, I emphasize that passing through a compounding event at an interest rate r while moving forward in time picks up a factor of (1+r), while moving backwards through time (for present value) picks up a (1+r)\^{-1}. Now suppose that it's Sunday, February 1st. You invest P dollars every Sunday (including today) and compound at term-rate r on every *prime* day of the month. What's the value of your account on March 1st?

They know no formula will help them here. They just have to understand how compound interest works. Similarly, throw in different interest rates at different times. Build up to annuities and perpetuities. A lot of my students really struggle the first time they see annuities and have to apply the formula for the sum of a finite geometric series, but there are so many ""A ha!"" moments when students finally figure this out.

I was tutoring an electrical engineering student in electrodynamics, and they were tasked with describing the magnetic field around a platonic solid made of copper or something that had two battery leads on opposite ends and a current running through it. This guy was convinced that they needed to randomly apply formulas that ""looked good"" and were hell-bent on using the Kirchoff's equations for parallel circuits. This course was one of their first applied calculus courses, and the poor guy had whiplash and was totally fatigued on formulas they didn't understand and problems just outside their ability. I guess when it's been a long day, you have two or three possible formulas that you've been given on a silver platter, and you know exactly one is correct, it can definitely seem like a lot less work to flip a coin than to stop and think about it. Anyway, I asked why they felt that the parallel circuit equation he set up was the right formula to use. He gave some stupid non-commital non-explanation and I could tell he wasn't thinking critically, he was just trying to get this done. So I asked what happens to the current in a parallel circuit at a node where the current splits. I was fully prepared to follow up this question by asking where in the example problem does the current split (it didn't), but asking the follow up question was unnecessary. They pondered for awhile, realized the current didn't split, and they solved the problem themselves. When I asked how sure they were about their new answer, they said they were 90% sure they got it right, and I praised them and we moved on.

Next time you're lecturing and it's time to select a formula, consider this. Pick a random student (C or B average at most) and ask them what formula they think you should use. Then, ask them how sure they are that they're correct. If they are sure, let them explain why. If they aren't sure, cut them off abruptly and move on to a student and start the process over until you find someone who is sure and correct. Alternatively, if you have a snappy question that gets to the heart of what they aren't realizing (like 'what happens to the current when it splits?' in my example), ask the Socratic question and continue the process with the original student and then compare the underlying thinking and confidence levels for their first answer and for their final answer. This kind of lecturing encourages thinking about math through intuition, and it puts exemplary thinking on display alongside shoddy thinking in a way that, if done correctly, encourages students to cultivate their own math intuition.

This is so beautiful! The biggest lesson I learnt in Math/problem solving is that my previous approaches of keeping a checklist of formulae in my head (and writhing with my anxiety if the question suggested a formula that I only sort of remembered) was silly. Instead, learn certain proof paths really really well. So given a few very simple theorems, you can re-derive formulae to solve most problems. Now, this adds a bit of time to easier ""plug and chug problems"" (to an extent, but the formula eventually enters your working memory) but it is remarkably effective in trickier problems which require going back to first principles and hacking together a formula.

An analogy that works on many levels is to think of a formula as _code_. Memorizing code is considered to be silly (at least IME), so maybe we should view formula memorizing from the same lens.

For example, just as we begin talking about infinite series in Calc 2, I give them an exploration assignment designed to get them to discover p-series by playing with a desmos environment which creates animated plots of the partial sums for any series the kids type in the summand for.  I give them a few examples and then ask them to come up with a few more of their own of a particular form. Then I ask them to conjecture about when these types of series converge.


Picture drawing is definitely something you can build in practice with.  When my college algebra classes talk about proportionality I give them an activity where they sketch several circles of given radii (with some helpful tools) arranged on the page so they can compare the areas.  The assignment leads them to try and answer the question ""what happens to the area of a circle when it's radius doubles?""

There are lots of ways to build in the calculation of examples.  Really useful in Calc classes, eg, when exploring limits and indeterminate forms in Calc 1.

These are just off the top of my head.  The real challenge is balancing the right amount of these exploration type assignments, and the classic skill-building ones.  It seems like students used to be expected to do this sorts stuff on their own to gain mastery and understanding of concepts.  Now we are required to hard-build them into the curriculum which isn't bad, but definitely takes away from the time we can put into raw skill building.

StrawberryOdd7750,hjw62mc,"Much of our mathematics is (either consciously or unconsciously) effected in great part by the physics we experience. Our intuition for geometry, for instance, begins with how we perceive and experience objects in real life. Likewise, the mathematical objects we care about and use are influenced by what objects the universe seems to use. I can’t imagine physics without waves, and therefore, something akin to the work of Fourier is likely to be found in alien civilizations. The development of math is intimately tied to experience, and every being in the universe experiences the same physical laws

Edit: Conversely, we could try to imagine how math might develop differently had the rules of physics been changed. In our experience, causality depends on distance— things far away effect is less than things close to us. We can ultimately trace this down to the finite speed that information propagates (information can’t propagate faster than the speed of light). Because information takes time to travel, the interaction of things must be inherently local, it can’t depend on information far away since it’s impossible to access this information faster than the speed of light. The notion that causality is doesn’t in distance naturally leads to something like calculus and differential equations, where we look at local properties like the derivative. To a species where causality didn’t depend on distance, differential equations would seem odd, since why would one ignore the further away properties when they are just as important? The very notion of distance itself has baked into it the notion of what is far away and what is close, but this is ultimately due to being able to separate “close” and “far” from each other, which might not be possible if information propagated in a different way",54,Alien maths,1totheInfinity,/r/math/comments/qptvh2/alien_maths/hjw62mc/,0.032,0.011,0.957,0.631

These include the speed of light, the charge of the electron, the number of spatial and time-like dimensions, etc. They are *apparent* because they seem to be *laws* but there’s no guarantee they are universal. For example in another universe, if it exists, these “laws” may be different or not exist at all. It is conceivable that in an another universe, the speed of light is 60mph and hydrogen doesn’t fuse.

Then there are *fundamental laws*, which are derivable by theory alone. For example, laws of motion, laws of thermodynamics, the uncertainty principle, etc. Scientists think that no matter what kind of universe you live in, these laws will hold true.

Then I would consider a third category, *theoretical or logical laws*: The ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter is a constant (which we call pi), that certain numbers are prime, etc. These laws are true even in the absence of a universe altogether.

Now having established this, one has to wonder which properties they might be interested in. Postulating neutral elements makes sense, but what about other things? Well, if we can put two things together, why not three or four? But wouldn’t it be strange if these terms became more and more complex? Rather, we would like ourselves to be able to ignore the order of the applications of our operation - that’s a monoid! Now, what else? When we know how to combine things, why not think about whether something is made up in certain ways? Can we always find x such that ax = b, given a and b?

And hey, wouldn’t you know it: Aliens would probably enjoy reading our classification of finite simple groups!

In other words Economics. Even them trying to restrict their population so they don't run into resource issues (e.g. China's one child per family policy) would require them to count way beyond 4.

Whether this was considered applied or pure math is somewhat debatable, but convergence frameworks for numerically solving nonlinear PDEs is definitely considered applied math these days.

[Convergence of approximation schemes for fully nonlinear second order equations](https://content.iospress.com/articles/asymptotic-analysis/asy4-3-05)

One of the areas this comes up in applied math is developing numerical schemes that solve the continuous optimal transport problem with quadratic cost. This optimization problem boils down to a nonlinear second order Elliptic PDE known as the Monge-Ampère equation. Here's a paper where they use some of the theory developed in the first paper to solve a seismic waveform inversion problem.

I like to think of applied math being broken down into 2 different areas. You have pure applied math and applied applied math (yes, I'm being somewhat silly). The pure applied math people develop theory and provide proof for mathematical frameworks of applied math problems. One big area here was the theory of PDEs from physics problems. The applied applied math people are more focused on modeling, results, and just using very high level math as a tool. This doesn't mean the math they do is any less theoretical or complicated, just the sort of problems they are interested in don't tend to require proving things as often. Of course this is a rule of thumb and it doesn't always apply.

r_transpose_p,hjvma7w,"I did my graduate work in an applied math program, after doing an undergrad degree in computer science.

I've half-jokingly told friends that what I majored in in graduate school was best described as ""like physics, but without the physics"".

That said, there were definitely people in my program doing work that was closer to straight-up physics.

What you mostly learn to do is to do the sort of mostly-computational math that underlies present-day work in physics and engineering, along with, depending on what kind of program you go to, a healthy dose of statistics (\*extremely\* useful field, btw)

Some departments also have clusters that do work in other areas, like optimization, or control theory. Those are pretty cool fields.

In practice, if you end up in any of these areas, you'll commonly encounter ""inverse problems"" -- problems where there exists a straightforward analytic or computational solution to the forward behavior of a system, and you're supposed to compute, given an outcome of the system, what the likely inputs were.  These come up in everything from geoscience (we listened to the echoes of explosions and tried to figure out where the oil was from those) to medical imaging (PET gives you a dataset of infinite lines, and you're supposed to estimate a density map of where those lines likely originated, while MRI and something called dtMRI have similarly gnarly underlying problems).  This is where computation, applied linear algebra, and statistics all come in super-handy.  A friend of mine in the program whose research was way more ""no, this is straight-up physics, but advised by a different department"" did her thesis on an really cute inverse problem whose application was figuring out what a particle beam was doing given some very indirect sensor measurements of some aspects of beam dynamics.

If you want to, instead, do the sort of math that underlies modern computer science, you would do that either in a pure math program, or in a computer science program (you get to do a lot more math in computer science at the graduate level than at the undergraduate level -- especially if that's something you \*want\* to do)

Note : not all applied math graduate programs are like this.  Mostly they cluster into two kinds

1. take coursework as if you're doing a regular pure math major, then, after maybe a few specialty courses, do research in ""physics, but with less physics"".  I think CMU and NYU are a bit like this.
2. don't take the pure math core, instead take a special applied math core of courses, whose contents are still kind of emerging, but which will involve a healthy dose of PDE, ODE, numerical linear algebra, and statistics.  The nice thing about applied math as a field is that a lot of universities are just now building departments of this kind, and they're all going to need to hire faculty.  If you try to get a pure math faculty job, you pretty much have to wait for someone to die in order to get a job.  If you specialize in applied math, not only can you apply for applied math faculty positions, but you may be able to apply for faculty positions in engineering fields related to your research.  My thesis advisor, for example, switched universities and now teaches in an engineering department.  His research didn't change when he switched departments/universities.

If you want a good idea of what present-day cutting-edge research in applied math is like, a good thing to skim, if your university library has it (it should) is the publication ""SIAM Review""

[https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-review-sirev](https://www.siam.org/publications/journals/siam-review-sirev)

I think my favorite articles in there was a survey article on various techniques for modeling traffic flow (you know, cars on a freeway) with PDEs and related techniques.  You might have different tastes and prefer different topics.

I'm not published in it.  SIAM Review is for the really good stuff that, either because of quality or applicability, has a broader audience than the various SIAM sub-journals.  I published in one of the sub-journals once.  I'm still proud of that (even though it was sort of an unstated committee requirement that I publish at least once in something of that caliber -- whatever, I'm still proud of myself for having done at least the minimum).  The back-and-forth on getting a paper accepted to one of these journals ... well, it makes ""your first code review at Google"" seem gentle by comparison.

It is particularly good for elliptic differential equations - stress distribution in irregular objects and steady state heat flow.

orangejake,hjua0od,"I work in cryptography, in particular lattice-based cryptography. Perhaps the most exciting development in the field is the 2009 development of *Fully Homomorphic Encryption*.

Briefly, encryption is morally similar to locking a document in a safe. It keeps the document safe from people, but has a significant downside --- what if you want to look at the document? You have to unlock the safe, which can be annoying.

 Fully homomorphic encryption is a cryptosystem for which encryption is (mostly) a ring homomorphism. In particular, given two encryptions c0 = Enc(m0), c1 = Enc(m1), there are algorithms to (publicly) compute Enc(m0 \* m1) and Enc(m0 + m1). Over finite fields, this suffices to compute any function.

This is both neat puzzle to work on/solve (it had been open since public-key encryption had been developed in the late 70's), and industry seems quite interested in it. But it also has a decent amount of interesting mathematical content --- for example, the most common speed optimizations use algebraic number theory (not that deep of stuff from the field --- you could teach it to advanced undergrads or early grad students) in a key way to go from roughly quadratic-time operations (and quadratic size keys) to quasi-linear, i.e. get an O(n) speedup in a number of important efficiency metrics.",4,Specific examples of developments or interesting papers in applied math?

burnthisnameafteruse,hjwhbys,"Analysis, Linear Algebra are the easiest imo.  Analysis is more visual in terms of continuity and mapping; however, LA offers more of a ""puzzle"" and like Gilbert Strang always says ""You can never learn too much Linear Algebra"".  

I think of Applied Math like a passions subject for Mathematicians that could be Engineers and Engineers that should be Mathematicians.  If you do not want to pursue making an impact in an industry and you are not content with an EE PhD, then look for something more abstract.  If you want to get heavily into FORTAN, coalescing memory, or something more based in Physics, then yes! Go applied math.

However, you do not theorize Applied Math, you discover it and if you are not prepared to spend a whole career ""not finding"" anything then go all in on it.  If anything you can leave and go start making 6 figures almost immediately.  I met someone who did a MS in Math then went on to do a PSci in Sociology.  Cross-discipline careers make the most impact in academia because you branch out of a subject that has pushed you to the outer-limits of thought.

I would say the current trend is statistics of carbon emissions, weather balloon work (heavy programming), and of course blockchain ground work.  I would say blockchain is more or less of a software endeavor but there are some pretty intense problems that pop up with applied cryptography, map theory, etc.

What your professor means is learn Python because messing around with numbers on a computer is easier than theorizing and implementing an idea.  In the 50's and 60's Applied Math went from chalkboard to punchcards; however, people now just run tests on small ideas then scale them with computing.  A great area of research is applied cryptography and finding spaces between prime numbers.  A lot of money backs it and one discovery grants you $100k and most likely a spot for research somewhere doing something.  Also quantum cryptography has a lot of issues but massive benefits if you wanted to jump down that rabbit hole.",1,Specific examples of developments or interesting papers in applied math?

gratus907,hjwltf0,"As a CS/Math major, I think my view might be slightly different with Physics/Math. My primary interest is graph-related stuff, but as you aren't really interested in computer science I would like to share something which might be more of your taste :)  

Mathematical optimization and numerical analysis is very interesting field. For example, you can solve some important (though importance is not objective, as we talk about 'applied' math I will intend real world applications) problems such as TSP which is used in various tasks, first one coming up to my mind is optimizing logistics. Also, mathematics regarding optimization (convex opt, etc) plays a key role in machine learning. Analyzing optimization algorithms is a very difficult task using quite a lot of math (not only sophomore level analysis and linear algebra. I've seen some algorithms using heavy probability theory).

In my opinion applied math is a huge term depending on 'how rigorous you want applied math to be' (in the spectrum, I would say). Since other people shared a lot about algorithms used in other fields, I will take one step toward math-y area and share some examples:

- Stochastic Gradient Descent is used everywhere in deep learning, but theory about it's convergence still has some rooms for improvements.

- Nowadays, deep learning utilizes some more complicated optimization algorithms such as Adam and it's variants ([https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04747.pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.04747.pdf)) . Interesting fact is that for these algorithms, it is very very difficult to mathematically characterize their convergence. Adam cannot be proven even under convex conditions([https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryQu7f-RZ](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=ryQu7f-RZ)).

As you ask very basilar concepts of LaTeX you obviously can't write it down fast enough to be able to follow a lecture in real time.

So in your situation here are the options I see. Most of them involve LaTeX one way or the other:

1. Use some graphical non-LaTeX environment like [http://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net](http://visualmatheditor.equatheque.net)
2. Slowly learn your way to LaTeX. There are plently of stuff that do not require you to be acquainted with the whole typesetting language. GUI-ish editors ([https://www.mathcha.io/editor](https://www.mathcha.io/editor) , LyX, EqualX, ...).
3. *My recommendation* : use Obsidian, or Joplin, or a markdown editor with KaTeX/MathJax capabilities. Let's say you want to write a squared. It's as easy as writing $a\^2$ in those editors. And they come with very good note organization utilities.
4. Learn to use the full blown LaTeX in a very customizable editor. Build your configuration and shortcuts and you can be a magician like that guy who uses vim (and note how he integrated Inkscape to draw beautiful pictures and integrate them seamlessly with some keystrokes): [https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/) . Usually building such a setup requires years of fine tuning and some programming experience but if you are starting your studies you may consider it. You won't be proficient in the first year - this I can assure you.
5. Other alternatives: use Mathematica syntax, like Sqrt\[x\], use Unicode symbols and ingenuity : ∂ₜ ( e\^(i2πt) ) = i2π e\^(i2πt), use MS Word Equation editor, ecc...

Really do not ignore figures. They are a very important part of understanding math.

HNSUSN,hjtxrs5,"Lots of suggestions to use a tablet, which you said in your post you are not open to. As others have said, using Latex in real time is a losing battle. Even if you manage to get everything into your notes, you’re going to be so focused on that, you’re going to miss everything in the lecture. If you’re hell bent on that, my recommendation would be to record the lectures (ask your professor first), have some paper on the side to write down any lines you can’t Tex right away (along with a time stamp, and a note in your Tex notes to go back and add it), and focus only on getting literally what’s written on the board in your notes. Go back after class, listen to the lecture, add in any spoken notes you want to have in there, and figure out how to Tex the missing lines. You’ll have beautiful notes, and you’ll get really good at Tex. But at what cost???

If you cave and decide to get a tablet, I’ll just chime in to say that getting a tablet was life-changing for me as a math student, particularly in the picture-heavy subjects (e.g. topology).

Its called a 'wacom tablet'. As it's just a matte or textured writing surface its much cheaper than an actual tablet and doesn't have the 'slippy' feel of writing on a screen so could be something to look into?

okaycthulhu,hjvqz09,"I got my PhD in math bio and now work in industry doing modeling of autoimmune diseases and immuno-oncology.  Here are three things that would’ve helped me to know 15 years ago:

1. Know the fundamentals and practical aspects of nonlinear dynamical systems forwards and backwards.  Someone else mentioned Nonlinear dynamics and Chaos by Strogatz, which is an exceptional book.  Right next to it in the math bio pantheon IMHO is Leah Edelstein-Keshet’s book Mathematical models in biology.

2.  Learn enough biology to be able to read and understand the literature and converse with the biologists in their language.  In the ideal case, good biology leads to beautiful math which leads to even better biology, but it requires a lot of good bidirectional communication.  Make contacts with the bio/biochem/biomed engineering programs, join a grad student journal club, maybe even try to work in a lab rotation if your PhD program will allow it.  Nothing gives insight into the challenges of modern biology than doing it yourself.

3.  Don’t limit yourself to “traditional” math bio topics (dynamics, epidemiology and populations, basics of modeling, etc).  Take a numerical analysis sequence to really understand how the algorithms work and how to optimize your models to work with them.  Learn nonlinear optimization (half if not more of my job is parameter estimation).  And if you want to, bring some of your pure math into it.  There’s tons of room for graph theory, differential geometry/control theory, and others to make real contributions to math bio.

As for simulations, really just dive in.  Matlab and Julia are probably the best starting points (Matlab is very easy and very well documented, Julia is mostly more powerful and freely available).

First of all if you want specifically differential equations, the field to look into is probably systems biology. Look up an intro textbook and get reading! 

Second I would recommend checking out population genetics. I'm biased because it's my field but I do think it's great for mathematicians to break into biology and to understand genetics and biological concepts in a mathematical framework. Graham Coop has excellent notes online that you can work through. 

Phylogenetics is also worth checking out. Look up Felsensteins pruning algorithm - basically it's belief propagation applied to tree structures. There are tutorials online.

Hope that gives you a starting point. It's not just differential equations in mathematical biology. I use a lot of linear algebra and probability theory personally.

Do you imagine this would foster an interest in literature?

Unfortunately, this is how people tend to encounter math. I don’t mean this as a takedown of math education; it’s just that mathematics is so structure-dependent that it is extremely difficult to engage the more complex results of mathematical labor without having a lot of math’s equivalent of grammar already under your belt. You can’t really do the equivalent of diving into a great novel and enjoying it despite missing a lot of the finer points. Without adequate background, most deeper mathematics is less accessible than James Joyce’s *Ulysses*. 

Of course, there are straightforward results that are beautiful, but those often feel more of an aside than an encouragement to slog through algebra. What has often worked for me is engaging each problem like a puzzle to solve, but, then, I enjoy puzzles, and your mileage may vary.

Euclidean geometry was not overturned when Einstein came along, but rather the physical belief that our university is Euclidean at all scales. In the physical world we don't know if pushing the experiment into some new regime of values might falsify it. That doesn't happen in math once you provided a theorem (assuming the proof is valid and the hypotheses are clearly understood).

Agreeable_Junket_271,hjumtd3,"I feel like this argument is too focused on semantics.

It's pretty clear (I hope) I was talking about Euclidean geometry. In my eyes, the statement is not 'just' an axiom that came from nowhere, historically. The statement was written down because it describes our human intuition of the truth of how these objects should behave in that scenario. Before the axiomatic method was adopted, math still existed. Math was still math, the original philosophizing about the logical reality. It's the _way_ in which math was _done_ which changed over time, necessitated by the need for a higher degree of precision to obtain knowledge, and there's no reason why it shouldn't change in the future under a new paradigm.

And the fact that it's not a theorem to be proved is exactly my point: that there exist things that seem like fundamental truths to a human, but will not be able to be proven by lesser beings like Meeps who will then resort to experimentation to glean the truth of such facts.

And iyou are free to claim experimentation is only within the realm of science. But again, it's just semantics. I wasn't asking whether or not experimentation is 'math' or 'science', the more interesting question I think was whether we feel the experimental method has merits in seeking mathematical truth.

I also didn't say that experimentation would be valid in every scenario (for example, the one that you stated). But counterexample doesn't prove non-existence, and obviously the proof method is our most powerful (and beautiful) tool we have developed. But also, it is important to note that the method of proof didn't always exist, and the existence of mathematical studies arguably predates it.

Some set theorists are platonists (i.e. they believe that sets are fundamental objects that we _describe_ using the set theory axioms, but sets are not _defined_ by these rules). So, many of these platonists will argue that the continuum hypothesis _actually_ has a truth value and that the ZFC set theory axioms are an incomplete description of how sets behave.

At the opposite spectrum, some set theorists are formalists (i.e. they see ZFC set theory as purely symbolic manipulation, they are interested in studying the consequences of such symbolic manipulation without regard to their ""platonistic meaning""). These people don't see the independence of the continuum hypothesis as an issue, but merely as a consequence of how we defined the ZFC axioms and the rules for symbolic manipulation.

Another example of platonism vs formalism is higher dimensional geometry (e.g. 4-D geometry). Platonists in this area will believe that the higher dimensional objects they are describing are truly fundamental, despite the human mind not being able to 'see' them.

cocompact,hjwevnz,"What you are suggesting seems sort of like a cop-out, along the lines of ""We haven't been able to solve that problem for 50 or 100 years, so let's just assume it's true because the numerical evidence looks overwhelming to the layman."" It's as if you lack faith in the capacity of human creativity to develop the appropriate concepts to solve really hard math problems. The track record of *successes* in mathematics where we only accept a conjecture as settled when it is proved, not when it has a million pieces of numerical evidence, is extremely strong and robust.

Let's consider an example like Goldbach's conjecture or the 3x+1 problem, where the numerical evidence seems pretty compelling to anyone who is unaware of things like the Skewes number that bounds the size of a counterexample that has never been explicitly found.  There is *no actual knowledge* gained by saying ""let's now assume Goldbach because of numerical evidence"".  That is, you can't solve any real problems just by assuming something like Goldbach.  While Goldbach and 3x+1 are famous because almost anyone can understand them, merely assuming them to be true is kind of worthless: what do you gain by just assuming them? The reason mathematicians are attracted to hard problems is because the *solution* to these problems will no doubt lead to novel techniques and concepts that may be applicable to solve other hard problems.  The case of Fermat's Last Theorem is a good illustration: on its face, Fermat's Last Theorem is sort of dumb because the fact that x^n + y^n = z^n for each n > 2 has no solutions in positive integers has no important consequences at all. But the *methods* Wiles (and Taylor) developed to solve FLT had very important consequences in number theory (e.g., the proof of modularity of all elliptic curves over Q and the proof of the Sato-Tate conjecture).  None of those  successes are based on FLT itself, but on the *ideas* created for the proof of FLT.

The case of the Riemann hypothesis, which (in a suitably generalized form) is already known to have hundreds of consequences just from its statement alone, is really quite unusual in mathematics. What is nearly always more important for progress in math is not knowing that certain conjectures are true, but knowing *how* they are proved, because the details of the proofs are the seeds of future mathematical work.",5,philosophy discussion: experimentation as a valid method to obtain knowledge about the mathematical universe where proofs fail?,Agreeable_Junket_271,/r/math/comments/qplkjm/philosophy_discussion_experimentation_as_a_valid/hjwevnz/,0.144,0.082,0.774,0.969

I would suggest this isn't even the most useful lens to look at them through.

I think it's better to focus the discussion like this: we *don't care* whether axioms are true or not. In fact, the question of their truth has no meaning.

People tend to think that math produces knowledge in the form of provably-true propositions like ""*p*"". But *all* mathematical knowledge is really of the form ""this particular set of axioms **implies** *p*"".

Now, when we *use* a mathematical result in the process of doing science, this is a whole other story. But this still has absolutely nothing to do with assuming that the axioms underlying that math are ""true"". We adopt that mathematical model purely when it happens to have explanatory/predictive power in our scientific model, end of story.

Agreeable_Junket_271,hjuysu8,"I don't dispute what you say here. I'll distill my proper question here and am curious on your opinion.

Let us focus on the subset of mathematics that feels fundamental to human intuition and our ideas of truth.

Let S = the set of mathematical statements that have a proof that have a proof that can be understood by some human in the present or future

Let T = the set of statements about the mathematical universe that feel meaningful and interesting to us at a fundamental level

Do you think T is a subset of S? Why or why not? If not, then it stands to question whether experimentation is our only choice of filling the holes that proof cannot. The knowledge gleaned from experimentation is never certain, of course, but it's better than nothing.

Mathematicians who engage in such experimentation, would be dubbed ""mathycists"" who are to the mathematical universe as physicists are to the physical universe. Like the mathycist, physicists can never be certain about the physical laws they write down, yet the findings they have hold value until a counterexample occurs.

And something to note is that we are able to accept Euclid's axioms because humans are intelligent enough to find such statements ""obvious"". At the same time, our limited intelligence doesn't allow us to write more scary statements down as axioms because they aren't as obvious to us as perhaps a higher intelligence species would find it. How then, would we arrive at these higher axioms via mathematics if mathematics is restrained to only being within the realm of deductive science? Where we are limited in everything we deduce being based only off of human-comprehensible axioms?

Were a monkey society to develop a mathematics based ONLY off of axioms that monkeys find obvious, the scope of their mathematical discoveries of truth would be considerably less than us humans, who in turn, would have considerably less scope than a more divine species.

From our perspective, truth exists independently of whether or not monkeys are able to comprehend this truth.

cocompact,hjwsor0,"I didn't say we *can* prove every statement that we are interested in, but rather that math is not at all suffering from making progress all over the place by having proof as its standard for what counts as making a math problem solved.

I also did not say intuition, analogy, and examples have no role to play. All I was writing about above was the standard by which mathematicians agree a problem has been solved.  Of course intuition, analogy, and examples (experiments) can guide us towards problems people feel it is worthwhile to work on. Gauss used numerical evidence to conjecture the prime number theorem, for instance. 

You ask why we can't let experimentation have its place.  It *does* have a place, such as its role in revealing new phenomena to explore or in providing data to support conjectures that were first made only on the grounds of elegance or heuristics rather than due to concrete examples.  For example, maybe in an area of math that is not part of probability, the use of probabilistic heuristics can suggest answers to questions that had not been asked before, and those potential  answers might turn out to be consistent with numerical evidence as far as the checking is done.  But I don't see why it would be a good idea to start calling those answers ""near-truths"".

I haven't seen you give an example of the value gained by calling something a near-truth when it is not yet proved.  I'd just call such a statement a conjecture, which is a standard label for something that some community of mathematicians believes might be true but still has not been proved.  I fail to see how any serious knowledge is gained by calling a conjecture ""nearly true"" instead of simply calling it a conjecture, and that's why I don't see the value of relabeling widely believed conjectures as ""near-truths""or whatever other new name you want to use.  If you decided to call Fermat's Last Theorem ""nearly true"" before the early 1990s when Wiles made his announcement, I don't see how that would have helped math at all.  

It is a worthwhile activity to understand the logical relations between numerous unsolved problems, since knowing certain conjectures are equivalent or that one implies the other means proving one of the conjectures  can help prove the other. This is ultimately how previous conjectures like the Poincare conjecture or Mordell's conjecture got settled in the affirmative: they were shown to be consequences of other conjectures that someone came along later and proved (Perelman or Faltings, for the two cases I mentioned). 

A concrete example of how an area of math can go off the rails when it starts accepting lower standards of rigor for what counts as a theorem is the Italian school of algebraic geometry in the 19th and early 20th centuries.  Their intuitions eventually outstripped their technical abilities to prove things. I am not saying their claims started to be overwhelmingly wrong; some mistakes were made, but many claims by the Italian school later got proved by Zariski, Weil and the next generation that gradually built up solid foundations for algebraic geometry based on commutative algebra and more abstract tools.
The Italian school of algebraic geometry then withered away (not that *Italians* as people working in algebraic geometry withered away!).",4,philosophy discussion: experimentation as a valid method to obtain knowledge about the mathematical universe where proofs fail?,Agreeable_Junket_271,/r/math/comments/qplkjm/philosophy_discussion_experimentation_as_a_valid/hjwsor0/,0.126,0.06,0.815,0.9906

For us, it is a grand conjecture. For a hyper-intelligent alien species, who have the mental faculties of being able to hold in their mind every element in a countably-sized set, such a conjecture may be as obviously true to them as an axiom as euclid's axioms are for us. They don't need a proof for it to know it's true. We need one, however.

The point is that humans may never be able to prove such a conjecture because none exist that can be deduced from the set of facts that we find obvious. The logical hurdle that separates us from this alien species being as large as the logical hurdle that separates dogs from us.

univalence,hjsim1h,"> there wasn't a real proof until Russell

If Frege's defintion of number is ""the first"", then surely Frege's theorem + the Peano proof would have been the first one, and since this was based on Hume's conception of number, it wouldn't be a stretch to say that the first proof is due to Hume.

But the idea that numbers weren't defined until someone made a logical formalism is why Russell style logicism shouldn't be taken seriously (except as historically important). There are (at least) 4 problems with Russell's view. (Although 3 of them are fundamentally the same: Why do otherwise incompatible approaches to arithmetic all agree that 1+1=2?)

The first is that the way Frege defines numbers is different from the way ZF defines numbers. If Russell is to be believed, only one of these formal proofs can be based on sound reasoning. We somehow need to account for the fact that different systems, which disagree about *what numbers are* can come to the same conclusions about arithmetic.

The second is [Benacerraf's identification problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benacerraf%27s_identification_problem). In short, there is no good reason to take one encoding of the naturals over another in (for example) ZF. Again, we somehow need to account for the fact that different accounts of what numbers are come to the same conclusions about arithmetic.

Third, we need to account for the fact that crucual arithmetic results (for example, Fermat's little theorem and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic) were proved before we had a definition of number. Again, if we believe Russell, we have to come up with an explanation for why ancient and early modern mathematicians were able to work so successfully with a concept that apparently was not yet defined.

Finally, this view is manifestly putting the cart before the horse: If, for example, [Frege's Theorem](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/frege-theorem/#S5) led us to conclude that 1+1=3, we would not conlcude that 1+1=3, but that Hume's principle was an incorrect way to define the numbers. I.e., we judge formalizations by their ability to capture pre-formal mathematical facts, as much as we judge pre-formal mathematical facts by their amenity to formalization.

In short, it seems very difficult to rectify the fact that *every* account of arithmetic agrees that 1+1=2 with the idea that there's not a real proof of a result until there's a formalism and a formal proof in it.

SecretsAndPies,hjwazkt,"I don't think the fact that productive work was done with numbers before the first definition of 'number' was given needs to be accounted for. For example, I would be hard pressed to formally define a dog, but I can certainly take my dog for a walk. The history of mathematics is full of people proving interesting results involving concepts yet to be made precise, and where the lack of precision actually caused problems (unlike with numbers). See, for example Lakatos' 'Proofs and Refutations'. So it is perfectly consistent that Frege, for the sake of argument, gave the first definition of number, and that earlier mathematicians had proved theorems about numbers.

Actually Russell himself disagreed with 'Russell style logicism' as you present it here. While I can't provide a reference off the top of my head, I recall a quote by Russell to the effect that axioms should be chosen to support the desired theorems. So Russell certainly did not believe that the concept of number required formal definition in order to be worked with. Russell and Whitehead's proof that 1+1= 2 should be understood as a proof that this a fact of logic, and so not a synthetic fact. This is the crux of the logicist project; to argue with Kant.

Benacerraf's argument doesn't really apply to Russell here. It's really an argument against strong set theoretic approaches to the foundations of mathematics. Russell's intention is something like 'there is a logical concept of number, and I will use this to show all facts of arithmetic are logical facts'.

Although, you're entirely right that most mathematicians don't worry about such things unless their interested in set/model theory or foundations.

 When working with the standard, set theoretic (say in ZF) model of the naturals we construct the naturals as sets.

Von Neumann's construction takes zero to be the empty set {}, and then the successor functions is s(x) = x \cup {x}. That is, to find a successor you union a number with a copy of itself enclosed in a set. In this way, numbers are identified as sets as follows,

Of course, once mathematicians know that real numbers can be constructed as sets, they then work with these numbers according to the axioms of a complete ordered field and ignore their set-theoretic underpinning.

adventuringraw,hjtyp78,"Here's the real crux in my view:

Russel's argument is that Peano's axioms have 3 unknowns ('number', '0', and 'successor') that give concrete form to the 5 abstract axioms. Russel points out that there are many instances of this general class of Peano arithmetic objects (call them 'progressions', say). The thing we call 	ℕ is only one possible progression, Russel gives others (he calls odd*, odd** and so on). For example, call '0' the thing we normally think of as 0, 'succ' be '+2'. In this new system, 1+1=2 is still true, but in our normal language, that expression corresponds to '2 + 2 = 4' since we've got different meanings for symbols now.
 
Anyway. All that specific nonsense aside, here's what's left: Peano just gives structure, Russel gives form. Peano showed '1 + 1 = 2', but he didn't show what '1' or '+' or '2' meant, that's up for the 'user' to define. But... up above, what'd the user who wrote '1 + 1 = 2' mean? It's a symbolic expression, taken abstractly Peano already showed it. We as the reader need to give meaning to the symbols to make it mean what we think it means, but we all already do that naturally just while reading the expression. No one's going to be confused by what's meant.

Informally, we could say a 'number' is a pile with some amount of stones. '0' is a pile with no stones. 'succ N' is a pile of stones that had N stones in it, plus a new stone. This concrete example can be shown to fit Peano's axioms, meaning our stone pile instance has been shown to follow all of the theorems of Peano arithmetic, including '1 + 1 = 2', if '1' and '2' and so on means piles of stones of different sizes. It takes an extra step in other words to 'apply' Peano's construction to something concrete you're interested in, but it's not hard to do, it didn't take Russel to do that. The fact that you can create consistent systems using Peano that don't 'mean' what we think when we talk about numbers doesn't mean much, since the user above that started this whole chain left that concrete meaning implicit. We all know what they 'meant'. Even if we don't, in the expression '1 + 1 = 2', you can leave the meanings of those symbols as open variables still, meaning that expression can be said to be true in Peano's system already, even if we're just talking about the abstract structure without any particular form in mind. In a similar way, we can say it's proven that any two sets of basis vectors for a vector space will always have the same cardinality, even though we could be talking about radically different objects when we say vector space, or basis vector. Writing that statement doesn't need to be about anything concrete, the same can be true about 1+1=2. Just depends on how you as the reader interpret things.

My view, Russel just gave a super low level set of definitions that can be built up into a thing that satisfies Peano's axioms, matches our intuition of what a 'number' is, and sits within a larger framework that you can build out to other areas of math too. It's powerful and important (especially when it comes to setting the foundations for type theory and a whole bunch of really important computer science questions) but I wouldn't say Russel is the first to show 1+1=2. Anyone that thought of a concrete instance of Peano while reading (like the stone example) already did that.",4,Did Bertrand Russell’s more rigorous ‘bottom up’ reconstruction of basic arithmetic lead to any significant novel results?,Greenface1998,/r/math/comments/qp1v0j/did_bertrand_russells_more_rigorous_bottom_up/hjtyp78/,0.072,0.033,0.896,0.9762
univalence,hjxfqxx,"Yes, you're correct. I was conflating (and responding to) a few different things that I disagree with in that comment.

The first is the parent comment's logic:

1. There was no definition of number until Frege
2. Russell's proof is the first (in the literature) that uses Frege's definition
3. Therefore, Russell's proof is the first proof of 1+1=2

If we want to believe this, then we really do have to account for productive work on arithmetic that was done before Frege's definition. Otherwise, it seems we are forced to conclude that mathematics began in the 19th century.

Underlying the argument 1-3 above is an implicit assumption that ""logical construction from first principles"" is required to make a ""real"" mathematical proof, and I think Benacceraf's problem (and my sort of ""meta-Benacceraf's problem"") are applicable here: we obviously cannot say that *any* formal definition suffices, and it is not enough (according to Russell's discussion in *Intro to Math Phil*) to simply give a model of PA (see his discussion abotu starting at 100, or taking even numbers, etc). So we need a *correct* definition. But these different systems, and different encodings in the same system are incompatible. They disagree about what numbers are. So we need to explain why one is mroe correct than another.

The final thing I disagree with is actually a disagreement with Russell: that Frege's definition is any more satisfying than just giving the PA axioms directly. Firstly, I find the logicist account of mathematics unconvincing, so this definition is no more motivating to me than appeal to PA directly. Part of the reason I find the account unconvincing is that numeracy (as in, the ability to perform complex calculations with numbers) seems as fundamental to our mathematical ability as our understanding of numbers as cardinalities:. For example, some of the earliest surviving mathematical texts show pythagorean triples, divisions, and area calculations, none of which are ""obviously"" a result of comparison of cardinalities, and we use the Peano axioms as a litmus test for ""defintitions"" of natural numbers in more general systems. So I don't think classes are any more conceptually fundamental than numbers qua numbers. I.e., An analytical definition of number in terms of (axiomatized, undefined) classes does no better job of grounding the idea of number than the PA axioms (or some other axiomatization of arithmetic) directly.

In fact, as far as I can tell ""The initial [up to isomorphism] model of arithmetic"" (where ""arithmetic"" is PA, or RA, or whatever), seems to me to be the *best* definition of natural number: it is agnostic about the foundational system (The analytical definition in ZF or given by Russell in Intro to math Phil satisfies this, while in something like MLTT or ETCS the definition of natural numbers is just an internal formalization of this), it captures the way we use theorems like Frege's theorem to verify our ""definitions"", and it captures our intuition that "" 'one' means one"".

Of course, I'm criticizing Russell here with an extra century of work on FoM to appeal to (and my username probably makes it clear where my philosphical loyalties lie), so I'm being a bit harsher on Russell than he deserves.

It feels like you're trying to access some platonic ideal of what numbers are, and that any sets representing this are some instance of that ideal. The way I see it: these models representing the naturals *are* the natural numbers. In this way, you can have two distinct models that are not the same set but can both model the theory of the natural numbers. In my mind, these are not distinct representations of the naturals, they are both equally valid of being called THE naturals.

After all, without working with a particular model, we are usually only pondering about the theory of the naturals (that is, what logical formulas are true within the naturals and etc). Without ever handling a particular model, there isn't any object you can point to or work with as a number.

I think I mentioned that there are many ways to think about numbers. I think the set-theory viewpoint is the most common way to define them. Anyone who takes set theory learns about it, and even mathematicians who don't like logic at least learn this little bit. It's not used day-to-day, but it is good background for every mathematician to know about.

What would you say is the most common definition for natural numbers?


>Set theory is not the only foundation (but yes by far the most common).

Sure, there are logicians working on foundations that aren't set theory. Homotopy-type theory, I think it's called? Probably others?

• Most mathematicians who’ve received training in set theory define the set ℕ of natural numbers to be *ω*.

• If we define a function *S*: ℕ → ℕ by *S*(*x*) = *x* ∪ {*x*}, then the ordered triple (ℕ,*S*,∅) is a Peano system.

• Define an equivalence relation ~ on ℕ × ℕ by (*m*,*n*) ~ (*p*,*q*) if and only if *m* + *q* = *n* + *p*, where natural-number addition + needs to be defined as a set.

This seems a lot more coherent than the talking point of ""removing gifted programs"". Barring statistical anomalies, the mathematical ability most kids 13 and younger will indeed be pretty similar (and their capability to learn will, similarly, be pretty similar to one another). In the rest of the framework, they speak about the negative effects of the ""gifted"" tracks and how they seem to segment unusually large portions of people from a realistic interest in STEM, so the through-line is at least coherent to me and I have to imagine the intention is exactly as stated, create a mathematics curriculum that broadens American mathematical knowledge and participation to compete globally.

The letter in the OP doesn't have any legs for *why* these things are bad. Mathematics isn't the exact same as pedagogy, so I can't pretend like I know best here, which is why I'll tend to defer to those proposals built by people who study teaching.

For example, let's use the following bullet point from the letter:

""Promotes fringe teaching methods such as “trauma-informed pedagogy.” \[ch. 2, p. 16\]""

As someone who doesn't study pedagogy, this doesn't mean a single thing to me. I did not know prior to reading this what ""trauma-informed pedagogy"" is. The letter makes no effort to explain this to me. The intention is such that I read this, identify the words ""fringe"" and ""trauma"", and make a correlation in my head that this is a wacky leftist idea that is going to make our kids worse for some reason.

But instead, I read the reference:

""Trauma-informed pedagogy in mathematics highlights the importance of allowing students to identify and express their feelings as part of mathematics sense-making, and to allow students to address what they learn about their world by suggesting recommendations and taking action (Kokka, 2019). However, not all mathematics problems need to be related to the world—students can be fully engaged exploring pure number patterns, for example. In the following examples, two problems are highlighted; one is purely numerical, and one draws from real-world data.""

This is it. One single line which tells me what this form of pedagogy emphasizes, and offers a clear connection to mathematics (using it as a tool to inform real-world actions, coincidentally offering an answer for ""why are we learning this"", every uninterested student's most common refrain). The phrase isn't mentioned, as best I can tell, in any other section of the framework. This single line is worthy of an open letter with all the scare-mongering?

Eg, they are claiming that the new proposal rejects the Algebra 1 track for middle school and then cite Chapter 9, page 43 of the new proposal itself. Their claim of ""on par with high-performing foreign countries"" is not backed or cited.

If we go to that part of the proposal, this is the linked paragraph:

>An important idea conveyed in this framework is that all students deserve access to high-level mathematics curriculum. The tradition of ability grouping and tracking students in the elementary and middle years has resulted in widespread racial inequalities and the filtering of many students out of pathways that are perceived as mathematics-dependent (including science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). In addition, there is research demonstrating negative effects of ability grouping and tracking on those in the “high” group or track as well (Becker, Neumann, Tetzner, Böse, Knoppick, Maaz, Baumert, & Lehmann, 2014; Mulkey, Catsambis, Steelman, & Crain, 2005). This framework recommends that all students take the same, rich mathematics courses in K–8. The chapters describing high school pathways and data science set out a structure for high school that will be new to many administrators, including the provision of a pathway in data science and statistics that can be taken as an alternative, or in addition, to calculus. This pathway should be open to all students, not only those who have been selected as mathematically oriented in younger grades. The provision of real data, and the encouragement of students to ask their own questions of the data, has the potential to broaden participation and make Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) pathways considerably more equitable. As new courses are developed and introduced into schools, it is important that administrators hold equity as a guiding principle and work to encourage equitable participation in the new courses.

They are critiquing the railroading of students who are identified as ""gifted"" in elementary school onto an ""advanced math track"" that eventually leads to calculus in high school. Their claim is that this systemically excludes minority groups, allowing only privileged groups onto access to that privilege, and they also claim that there are negative impacts on the learning of ""gifted"" kids by sequestering them during their math education. Notably, they cite two papers for this (an *et al* or two would have been nice though). They then advocate for ""rich"" middle school classes along with a Data Science and Statistics track option in high school rather than making Calculus the only option. This doesn't necessarily exclude Algebra 1 in middle school, but it does reject the exclusivity of an advanced track that students must be on in order to gain access to Algebra 1.

Based off of what is in the document, I would say that the letter does misrepresent what the proposal is claiming in this section. Moreover, it does use wording that enables this representation unprofessionally and it does not cite its claims about other countries (let alone establish the importance of Algebra 1 in middle school for STEM success). So while they do cite the proposal (and only the proposal), they are misrepresenting the content of the proposal and so they are not honestly engaging with it. Given that this is from a libertarian think tank, I'm not surprised.

>But *your* critique is also flagrantly dishonest.

popisfizzy,hjuqs0m,"I've been trying to work on my paper over the weekends, cuz after I get off work during the weekdays I'm usually too drained to get any work in on it. Managed to fuck that up this weekend, so I'm going to try and squeeze a little bit of work in on it tonight.

During the weekdays I've been tinkering with an idea I had over the summer, which I mentioned in last week's WAYWO thread, about extracting ""geometrical-like"" data from graphs. Late last week I realized that one property I took as important actually isn't—it's just that the objects on graphs I *am* interested in all have this property, but that doesn't go the other way. I had to spend some time figuring out what the right property is and how to capture it formally. I think I have it now, and that ended up with me having to figure out an alternative way to define simple cycles on a graph. This alternative definition has the property, very useful for my purposes, that cycles on hypergraphs can be ""multidimensional"" in a sense in a way that depends on the way the hypergraph is connected. I think this gets me very close to formalizing this idea fully.

Lastly, while out driving over the weekend, I noticed something I thought of over the summer may be much more important than I first thought. This summer I had been thinking about alternative ways to define meshes. One of these definitions has a natural bicategorical structure, where the 0-cells are the points on the underlying set, the 1-cells (between points x and y) are the routes that carry x to y, and the 2-cells are the morphisms of routes. Given a mesh M, I call this the *category of movements* of M and denote it Mov(M). A particular detail of this definition is that hom(Mov(M)) actually has a categorical structure and every hom(x, y) is a full subcategory of hom(Mov(M))

Why this is important is that it allows one to encode ""embeddings"" of meshes that may not actually be there properly wrt the structure of Mesh (the category of meshes with their natural morphisms). One concrete example of this is for a certain relationship between simple graphs and manifolds. Simple graphs are sometimes thought of as approximations of manifolds. The way you do this is select a collection of points on your manifold, take these as the vertices of a graph, and then you connect these points with paths on the manifold and consider these the edges of your graph. This structure allows you to encode all this as a pseudofunctor where the domain is the graph (with the structure of a mesh) and the codomain is the manifold (again, with its natural mesh structure).

This is useful to me because I've been interested in trying to use ""simple meshes"", like graphs, as a way to build up approximations to more complex meshes and then using a limit of these approximations as a way to get to the more complex object. My hope is that if we do your carefully we can preserve useful information across this limit.",1,"What Are You Working On?

its_t94,hjuswak,"Sure, here's the gist of it: let (N,h) be a connected Riemannian manifold, ϕ:N → ℝ be a positive smooth function, and set (M,g) = (ℝ × N, -dt² ⊕ ϕ²h). This is the playground. A subset of a spacetime (i.e., a connected and time-oriented Lorentz manifold) is an achronal boundary if it equals the boundary of a future-set (i.e., an open subset which equals its own future). What I have proved is that if f:N → ℝ is a smooth function such that |df(x)(v)| < ϕ(f(x))||v|| for all x ∈ N and v ∈ TₓN, v ≠ 0, then the graph

B = {(f(x),x) ∈ M : x ∈ N}

is an achronal boundary. The obvious guess is that this graph equals the boundary of the set

F = {(t,x) ∈ M : t > f(x)}

and that this is a future-set. The correct way to do it is to note that if Φ: ℝ² → ℝ is given by

Φ(s₁, s₂) = ∫ dt/ϕ(t),

from s₁ to s₂, then the graph equals

B = {(t,x) ∈ M : Φ(f(x),t)=0}

and the candidate for future-set equals

F = {(t,x) ∈ M : Φ(f(x),t)>0}.

It turns out that those more complicated ways to express B and F are what make the proof easy, as opposed to the initial guesses.

chronondecay,hjruj9j,"Maybe I'll approach this question from the other direction, and give a natural example of when a logarithmic singularity occurs in a physical system (for appropriate values of ""natural"" and ""physical"").

We know from the theory of electrostatics and gravitation that the force exerted by a point charge or point mass is proportional to the inverse square of the distance. An equivalent description is that the potential of a point charge/mass at the origin is proportional to 1/r. Now it turns out that for a conservative, radially symmetric force, this is the only possibility: the potential for a conservative force must be a harmonic function (ie. the Laplacian is 0), except at the singularity, and when the potential is radially symmetric (ie. V=f(r)) we can write the Laplacian as

0 = ∆V(r) = 1/r^2 d/dr(r^2 dV/dr),

and solving this differential equation gives V(r)=C/r, as expected.

Now this is all good in 3 dimensions, but let's think about the analogous situation in 2 dimensions. It turns out that the Laplacian in this case looks like

0 = ∆V(r) = 1/r d/dr(r dV/dr),

and now solving this gives V(r)=C log(r). In other words, in 2D electrostatics or gravitation, force is proportional to inverse distance.

Yet another way of packaging what I just said is to state that the Green's function for the Laplacian has a 1/r singularity in 3 dimensions, but only a log(r) singularity in 2 dimensions.",60,Why does ln(x) not show up in differential equations?,GenerationSelfie2,/r/math/comments/qp5g2g/why_does_lnx_not_show_up_in_differential_equations/hjruj9j/,0.07,0.0,0.93,0.9224

PiperArrow,hjsx110,"> For that matter, why don't I see tangent, cotangent, secant and cosecant more often in solutions to mass spring damper systems or other controls problems?

If you're a senior in aerospace engineering learning controls, then you're almost certainly learning only about LTI (linear, time-invariant) system. Our friends in the math community call the differential equations for LTI systems ""linear, constant coefficient"" differential equations, but it means the same thing. **The only solutions to linear constant coefficient differential equations are exponentials, sinusoids and damped sinusoids, and those multiplied by powers of t.** 

> is it mostly a product of the examples we're given ...

Yes. If you're only doing LTI systems, then you won't see these other functions.

> ... and the problem-solving methods we use?

No, the problems you pose have the solutions they have. It doesn't matter the tools you use to solve them.

There's a very good reason that you see only exponentials, etc. for LTI systems. We say ""linear, time invariant"" but it's more descriptive to say ""shift invariant"" --- the equations don't change if you translate the time index by say, t --> t + T. That means that if you shift a solution you must still get a solution. If you shift an exponential, you get the same exponential (but scaled in amplitude). If you shift a sinusoid, you get a sinusoid at the same frequency. If you shift, say, t exp(t), you get (t+T) exp(t+T)=A exp(t) + B t exp(t), which is also a solution.

But none of that works with log(t). If you shift log(t), you don't get a scaled logarithm, you just get a shifted logarithm. You solution is tied to the time index in ways that exponentials aren't.

As others have noted, you can get log(t) if the DE is nonlinear. But I doubt you are seeing a case like that as an undergrad in aerrospace controls.",14,Why does ln(x) not show up in differential equations?,GenerationSelfie2,/r/math/comments/qp5g2g/why_does_lnx_not_show_up_in_differential_equations/hjsx110/,0.104,0.028,0.868,0.9717

You then either just model it and not really worry about an explicit form, or you turn it into something else through approximation that *can* be solved. This typically means that you Taylor series it, which will give you positive powers on the derivatives which do not give logs. We imagine many things as being made from harmonic oscillators because we're approximating things to the second power a lot. Eg, mv^(2)/2 is a differential expression that is a second order approximation of the relativistic expression mc^(2)/sqrt(1-v^(2)/c^(2)). 

On the other hand, it really depends on what you're using as the dependent variable. If you have an material decaying, then its amount y=y(t) obeys y'=cy. But we could easily use the amount remaining to measure time instead and get t=t(y) and the equivalent differential equation would be t'(y)=1/cy which gives a log as the result.

cocompact,hjrnlvq,"I think this is partly an effect of the kinds of equations you are looking at.

1. Spring systems involve periodic (bounded) motion, so of course solutions to such equations will be dominated by functions like sin(t), cos(t), and complex exponentials.  Maybe a Heaviside term shows up, but that's not going to lead to logarithms.

2. Functions like tan(x) and sec(x) blow up in finite time, so it makes sense you don't encounter those kinds of functions in mathematical models for systems you study.  

3. Every solution to a linear ODE with constant coefficients will be linear combinations of polynomials times complex exponentials (or polynomials times sines and cosines, which amounts to the same thing).  Do you *ever* enchanter differential equations that are not linear with constant coefficients?


Since your solutions involve exponentials, if you want to *invert* your solutions then you would encounter logarithms.  For example, if you have some kind of exponential growth y = Ce^(kt) then t = (1/k)ln(y/C).  Two particular kinds of time where logarithms famously appear are in half-life or doubling time: t*_1/2_* = (ln 2)/|k| is the half-life if k < 0.  It's a human artifact to focus on half-life as a measure of the decay rate, but if we wanted to computed the ""third-life"" (time for exponentially decaying quantity to decay to 1/3 of its current value) that would be (ln 3)/|k|.

Do you ever encounter arctan(x) in your solutions?  That is a bounded function and it is a logarithm in disguise: arctan(x) has derivative 1/(x^(2)+1), which after being written as 1/(x+i)(x-i) can be split up by partial fractions and then integrated to give you arctan(x) = (i/2)ln((1-ix)/(1+ix)) for real x.",7,Why does ln(x) not show up in differential equations?,GenerationSelfie2,/r/math/comments/qp5g2g/why_does_lnx_not_show_up_in_differential_equations/hjrnlvq/,0.079,0.044,0.877,0.7745

LinguaMathematica,hjs56om,"This is a very insightful question. I would argue that it is has to do with what the exp function does that all other functions (ln or otherwise) don't. The exp function has a deep connection to Euler's method for solving differential equations. In particular, the exp function can be understood as applying Euler's method with an arbitrarily small time-step. Since Euler's method is a robust strategy for solving all kinds of differential equations, it is no surprise that exp would show up all over the place in solutions for differential equations.   


cos, sin, cosh, and sinh inherit their superstar status directly from exp. After all, Euler's formula tells us that sin and cos are really exp in disguise, e.g. cos(x)=1/2\*(exp(ix)+exp(-ix)).

irondust,hjtmc19,"As u/back_door_mann mentions a reordering that improves the _locality_ of the computational grid (how close on average the indices of neighbouring degrees of freedom are) reduces the amount of _fill in_ (the number of new nonzero entries created) during a LU or Cholesky decomposition. An entirely different motivation is that it improves memory access. A big drawback of unstructured meshes such as those in FEM or FVM is that the more or less random order in which the entries in an array are accessed leads to frequent cache misses and thus slow performance. The speed of computation is often limited by how fast memory can be accessed (memory bandwidth) rather than the number of floating point operations per second a CPU can handle. By improving locality of the matrix you improve the chance that the neighbouring vector values you need to access in for instance a matrix-vector product are still in cache, because these may have already been accessed recently in previous rows local to the current one.

DasCondor,hjt5rtt,"Basic Algebra I and II by Jacobson. 

Its a 2 part Algebra text generally pretty advanced. I would say that the first book is on par with Dummit and Foote in terms of difficulty. You get Groups, Rings, Fields all the highlights. 

Its interesting because he defines everything in terms of a monoid  at first, and then a group as a special case. The material moves very fast, and it can be pretty dense. But there are a lot of examples and its decently readable. Book II is more categorical in nature. It starts w/ category theory and then gets more spicy from there, Homological algebras, field theory, communicative rings etc. I'm only like half way through book 1 however, so I cant really comment on II in depth.  each book is like $25 new. I got them for like $20 on amazon. They are quite long fyi about 700 pages each so price per page is good. 

As for topology, I don't have a reference in Dover but Topology by Munkres is available as a Pearson Classic edition, and can be had for $40 new.

When you try to split an integer greater than 1 into a *product* of smaller integers greater than 1, and you do this continuously until you can do so no longer, you get something far more interesting.

It's much easier to solve this for prime *p* or prime power *n=p*^(a)*.* In these cases, we deduce that the number of invertible elements is *p*^(a)*-p*^(a-1)*.* We can also prove the wonderful property of multiplicativity, which means that for *n* not prime, we can just multiply together the answers we got for each prime power in its factorisation. Going back to *n=7*5, we just note that the answer for *p*^(a)*=*3 is 2 and *p*^(a)*=2*5 is 20, so the answer for *n=7*5 is 40.

This of course doesn't explain why primes come up so often. When they do come up, it's often in an unexpected way. If you're familiar with modulo arithmetic, then you might know that working with (module p) , where p is prime, is nice because it's something which we call a number field. Why this is useful or true is hard to explain in one comment but it goes to show that primes can come up in an unexpected way. There are many examples like this.

ePhrimal,hjut8fo,"As others have pointed out, primes are central for studying integer problems and number theory in general. There are also some times when the integers are hiding inside some other structures, so that we can understand these better by using what we know about primes (i. e. mostly that they exist). Furthermore, even some of their most basic properties make them ubiquitous wherever arithmetic is used. They are thus hugely important for theoretical usage, practical applications, and didactic. I want to point out that the primes are also just extremely interesting (in my opinion anyway) conceptually.

For some mathematical structures, there are nice ways to decompose them into „smaller“ structures. When this works out very nicely, one can show that every structure from the considered class has a (unique) decomposition into finitely many indecomposable (primitive) elements, or that conversely every set of indecomposable elements leads to a unique structure encompassing them. 

In my opinion, this is one of the most interesting and, in sufficient generality, most important concepts in mathematics. It allows us to completely reframe the relationships and properties of the studied structures in terms of their decomposition into primitive elements: Instead of studying the structures “directly”, we can investigate how they decompose and how their primitive parts behave. Basically, we transform the whole question of how our object behaves into studying these primitive objects. This allows for new proofs, new problems, and concepts. Examples of this which immediately come to mind are finite groups, which can be studied using decomposition series and the classification of finite simple groups, secound-countable hausdorff manifolds in up to 3 dimensions, which have sort of been classified by Thurston’s geometrisation program, and the irreducible sets of Zariski spaces, which are foundational in Algebraic Geometry.

The most natural mathematical structure(s) are perhaps natural numbers. They are endowed with multiplication, which allows us to quite easily define decomposition by dividing out divisors, and find primitive objects. These are the primes - all that was mentioned before started when it was realised that they are a fundamental consequence of certain properties of the integers. This decomposition is well-understood. The primes are not. Now all of this leads us to basically trivialise many questions about natural numbers and integers, which I would argue is just not how we see it because we think we understand the naturals. But in fact, the primes show us that a very natural, intricate and highly elusive structure is hiding in plain sight anytime we begin to count. On the other hand, they also make clear that there is more to the integers than primes. For example, when trying to solve equations over the integers (diophantine equations), primes alone are not helpful. In fact, very heavy machinery is needed to study quite simple-looking equations. And indeed, it appears very heavy machinery is needed to study the quite simple-looking, beautiful primes.",2,Why are prime numbers significant?,fantom64,/r/math/comments/qp30sw/why_are_prime_numbers_significant/hjut8fo/,0.089,0.033,0.878,0.9753

> A common definition of a prime number is that it can only be divided by 1 and the number itself. For example:

• 6 is not prime, because it can be divided by 2 and 3 as well as 1 and 6.  
Using this definition, 1 can be divided by 1 and the number itself, which is also 1, so 1 is a prime number.

> • 13 is prime, because it can be divided by exactly two numbers, 1 and 13.  
• 6 is not prime, because it can be divided by four numbers, 1, 2, 3 and 6.  
1 can only be divided by one number, 1 itself, so with this definition 1 is not a prime number.

Of course there is. You know all those university professors in mathematics? All of them are doing research and developing new mathematical knowledge.

For any purpose you could possibly imagine. For example:

* I'm developing deductive procedures to prove computer programs correct.
* My ex girlfriend was looking into differential equations describing dynamical systems motivated by behavior of modern textiles.
* A couple of my friends are looking into the questions in the intersection of topology and computability theory.

jamesbullshit,hjxa081,"It really depends on what counts as a new field. The thing is, we probably won't find branches that are as universal as the classical ones: algebra, analysis, geometry, topology, combinatorics, probability theory and so on. Those are roughly the more fundamental aspects of mathematics and in a way is not conclusive of what those studies may be. For example, if someone tells you that they are working in geometry, it is ambiguous as to what kind of mathematics are they doing research on.

If you accept that some smaller division of mathematics should also be considered as a field, then there are considerably much more. For example, starting from the 1970s, quantum field theory and string theory has motivated a lot of research into areas that were not found before. This is due to conjectural properties of certain geometric objects based on physical principles. To name a few, both TQFTs and mirror symmetry are among some of the hottest topics that a large number of mathematicians/physicists are working on. A bit less related to physics, homotopy theory also has seen a rise in popularity and its incorporation with algebraic geometry is something new enough to be considered a new branch: these are the subjects of infinity categories, derived algebraic geometry and so on. Finally, for something sitting in the intersection of the two disciplines I have mentioned, we have geometric Langlands correspondence, which seeks to unify a large chunk of geometry and representation theory, using the language of derived algebraic geometry, and partially motivated by and building on physical ideas.

Of course my view is very much limited to what I know and have learnt. There are some areas of math that do seem to be a bit more stagnant.

Everything is incentives.  You can't just propose a policy and assume that all of the effects of that policy will be based on statistics under the current system.  People will alter their behavior in response to the changed incentives so as to benefit themselves.

But as soon as you enact this policy you get a second order effect where either people in circumstance X change their behavior in order to exploit this benefit, or other people will change their behavior in order to put themselves in circumstance X so they can gain this benefit, and the net effect will probably be negative, so I oppose policy A.""

zacker150,hjrrc0y,">(ii) One significant factor influencing the net economic productivity of a society can (imho) be modeled as: an optimization equation wherein the variables are how much money you award the nth most productive member of society. I think a lot of capitalists would agree with me about that, though they almost surely haven't explicitly stated it with such rigor.

Generally speaking, we model the economic problem as follows: Let X be the global distribution of assets. Assume each person has a utility function u\_i(X). Our objective when designing an economic system is to maximize the utilitarian social-welfare function U(X), the sum of everyone's utility function. (Note that there is a question of whether or not we can even add utility - see the debate on cardinal vs ordinal utility)

The first fundamental theorem states that in economic equilibrium, a set of complete markets, with complete information, and in perfect competition, will be Pareto optimal.

We might say each dimension of voter preferences is bounded by its own Overton window. Being popularly elected means optimizing against a surface of median preferences spanning those dimensions. Most politicians try to discover that surface and then match it, but the best politicians change the surface itself by applying boundary pressures against particular Overton windows. We call that leadership.

>How do you define productive member?

That's a whole another can of worms! There's no ""total-order"" that can be constructed that would be well-defined, that's certainly clear.

I think that there is however some meaningful way to assign a probability distribution to the productivity of members of society, along with a mapping from productivity level to yearly earnings that might feasibly lead to a more productive society than free market otherwise would.

Obviously there are so many details I'm sweeping under the rug that are significant, but this is something I've been thinking about a lot lately and here's an extremely simplified example that I think accurately illustrates why this is a problem worth tackling:

\_\_\_\_\_\_

e.g., Suppose you have 10,000 coal miners split into 100 groups of 100. For each group, you have a manager assigning $20,000 for their day of labor, based on the ranks of each coal miner's productivity. The miners will consequently mine with the manager's assigning in mind.

One strategy is guaranteed to beat all the other 99 strategies. It's accurate that in the probabilistic setting, there's some strategy that dominates in expected output provided that each worker has some probability distribution of output, conditional on the strategy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_

One consequence is that in the same way that the manager would never assign $20,000 to the highest producer (and thus $0 to everyone else), it might make sense that a ""winner takes all"" economy might not be as efficient as a different economy. In this sense, looking at the economy from an optimization lens might be effective, and might provide some rationalization for or against the wealth disparities we're seeing in the States for instance.",1,"Maths in politics: (i) What are some specific applications of math in politics, and (ii) what political opinions do you hold that have been influenced by your mathematical background?",0riginal_Poster,/r/math/comments/qp0kg6/maths_in_politics_i_what_are_some_specific/hjqzbby/,0.087,0.024,0.89,0.9633

>Moreover, the idea of pivoting to the center in a general election to attract votes from other parties is very widely seen whether or not a theorem says that under some idealized hypothesis it would be a good strategy.

I simplified a little bit by ignoring some of the very minor effects of me voting (but when you describe real world, you always have to omit something). Yeah, I guess if I vote, people will see a number 1 higher, when they look at the results of my favourite party, but that's not a big outcome to consider in my calculation. And with a very small probability, that one vote will help help the party reach a threshold for more funding from the government. I don't think these minor corrections change the calculation.

Of course, I am talking just about the action of me voting. If I talk about *encouraging other people to vote*, the calculation becomes different, because that might result in a large number of votes for my favourite party (and higher chance of making a difference).

Ok, I was reacting to the first two sentences of your post, which I thought were more far-reaching than the math stuff.

> (why are pro-gun people also predominantly pro-life? There's no a priori reason for that, they should be two independent positions). 

One could argue that, in the USA, both gun ownership and anti-abortion views can be linked with ""reaction"" the way that political scientists mean it. The loudest anti-gun-control voices in the last 40 years about (racialized) crime and the imposition of rules by decadent urban centers on rural people. Anti-abortion politics grew out of a reaction against birth control, and anti-birth-control politics were a reaction to women's liberation movements. (I am less up-to-date on pro-life politics of the last decade or so.)

In other words, both movements are reactions to big social changes, and this kind of ""reaction"" is a hallmark of...right politics! So they are related.

anon5005,hjs947z,"Admittedly a terrible answer here, but wne thing you could do is just formally copy the calculation when you have a surface S in affine space C^3 with coordinates x,y,z and try to generalize the Gaussian curvature to the complex setting. The three basic one-forms dx,dy,dz have a relation adx+bdy+cdz=0 unique up to scalars and there is a corresponding map to P^2 sending each point of the surface to the value of [a:b:c]. The two-forms on P\^2,  tensored with O(3),  is not only a trivial line bundle, it has a characteristic global section corresponding to da\wedge db\wedge dc as a three-form on affine three-space, and the pullback of this to the surface is a characteristic section of two-forms on the surface tensor the pullback of O(3). If the surface has an area form you can divide by this and end up with a characteristic section of O(3). We already know V cannot be complete, since it maps into C\^3, but if you extend the map to P\^2  to a map from a projective surface, this transformed area form necessarily has a nonempty divisor of poles, defined by the equation abc=0 somehow, when compared to any actual area form of the surface. I guess what I am saying is, for the surface to already have a nowhere zero area form it has to have zero first Chern class, but the codomain of the Gaussian map has Chern class represented by the negative of the divisor defined by the equation abc=0. If the pullback of an actual two-form on P\^2 were equal everywhere to a nonzero multiple of your area form the Chern classes would have to correspond.  They may well do since your starting surface is incomplete, but to get a well-defined ratio we have to choose a global section of O(3). For instance we could use abc itself, and then this only works if our surface maps into the complement of the divisor in P\^2 defined by abc=0.  So if we do not choose abc, which cubic form in the three variables a,b,c do we want to choose?

This allows -- and there does exist --  a well-defined real analytic area form that has no poles or zeroes. Another way of seeing the difficulty with trying to use the real concstructions of curvature using complex analysis is,  having any sort of universal complex analytic area form on P\^2 which you could use to get area form on surfaces mapping to P\^2 is that,  over the complex numbers,   any 'area form' of P\^2 itself -- meaning a complex analytic differential two-form -- has poles.  It is the same difficulty that on P\^1 with coordiantes [x:y] the differential of the well-defined function y/x has a double pole.

My answer is sort-of intentionally bad, trying to literally make the real calculation work complex analytically, and it just doesn't work.

I think you are right to say there should be less problems since the covering space step isn't needed.

You're right that H_1(P\^2(C))=0 while H_1(P\^2(R))=Z/2Z  and then our difficulty is that H\^2(P\_2(C))=Z. That copy of Z is where the order of the pole (=negative zero) of the complex analytic 'area form' lives, it is represented by the number -3. It is ""why we can't have nice things.""

LeonardHuang,hjs0w1p,"The path that you’ve taken is similar to the one that I myself took, but as a graduate student. My first exposure to functional analysis happened in a graduate-level class on operator algebras at TU Darmstadt, while I was a naïve sophomore in Germany as a foreign exchange student. Haha… You can imagine what a wake-up call it was — learning a difficult subject taught at the graduate level in a foreign language.

Notwithstanding the challenges of the class, it was a rewarding experience because I learned many fascinating topics, such as Banach spaces, Banach algebras, Hilbert spaces, dual spaces, the weak topology, the weak\* topology, the Hahn-Banach Theorem, the Banach-Alaoglu Theorem, the Krein-Milman Theorem, the spectrum of an element of a Banach algebra, the holomorphic functional calculus, *C*\*-algebras, von Neumann algebras, the continuous functional calculus, unbounded operators on Hilbert spaces, the spectral theorem for normal operators, the measurable functional calculus, and Stone’s Theorem for one-parameter unitary groups.

I learned these topics again when I became a graduate student myself. Some of the books that I studied from are Haïm Brezis’ *Functional Analysis, Sobolev Spaces and Partial Differential Equations*, John B. Conway’s *A Course in Functional Analysis*, John von Neumann’s *Mathematische Grundlagen der Quantenmechanik*, Walter Rudin’s *Functional Analysis*, and Helmut Schaefer’s *Topological Vector Spaces*.

As you already know, functional analysis is used a lot in the subject of PDEs (for example, the operator-semigroup approach to PDEs relies heavily on the theory of unbounded operators and the concept of the operator resolvent). However, it’s far from being the only subject to which functional analysis can be profitably applied, as I shall explain next.

In global analysis, functional analysis has been used to prove the celebrated Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem (please see the paper *The Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem as Passage to the Classical Limit in Quantum Mechanics* by George Elliott, Toshikazu Natsume, and Ryszard Nest).

Functional analysis has also been used to generalize important theorems in group-representation theory, such as the Mackey Imprimitivity Theorem and the Stone-von Neumann Theorem (at the risk of shameless self-promotion, I recommend my paper *The Covariant Stone-von Neumann Theorem for Actions of Abelian Groups on C\*-Algebras of Compact Operators* with Lara Ismert).

In case you didn’t know it, the Fields Medalist Vaughan Jones arrived at his famous polynomial knot invariant (the Jones Polynomial) via a study of sub-factors in the topic of von Neumann algebras. Therefore, functional analysis (specifically operator algebras) has had a huge impact on topology.",7,Functional Analysis Study/Research,kronecker_epsilon,/r/math/comments/qp4j72/functional_analysis_studyresearch/hjs0w1p/,0.073,0.038,0.889,0.9428

hrlemshake,hjvkfxt,"I'm an undergraduate who took a functional analysis course last semester and I quite liked the path our professor took (perhaps it could give you some insight into what topics are considered important). We studied the following:

1. Metrics and norms on VS, completeness, linear maps between normed spaces, Frechet- and F-spaces, Hilbert spaces (basics, ONB, convexity, duals)
2. Basic principles of FA (Baire, uniform boundedness, open mapping, closed graph)
3. Brief excurse into topology (basics, continuity, initial/final topologies, compactness)
4. Topological vector spaces (basics, separation properties, balanced sets, seminorms and local convexity)
5. Convexity (Hahn-Banach, Mazur separation theorems, bipolars, weak and weak* topologies, Banach-Alaoglu, Krein-Milman)
6. Reflexivity, Bourbaki's theorem, weak sequential compactness, closed image theorem
7. Compact operators, spectral theory, compact operators on Hilbert spaces

We were also meant to do a chapter on Fredholm operators, but we didn't manage to squeeze it in time-wise. All in all, I loved the course, the professor is a great lecturer and it was very much like you describe FA, i.e. a interesting brew of topology, linear algebra and analysis.",3,Functional Analysis Study/Research,kronecker_epsilon,/r/math/comments/qp4j72/functional_analysis_studyresearch/hjvkfxt/,0.11,0.03,0.86,0.9572

1184x1210Forever,hjp4zft,"Fourier series can be used to decompose a periodic function over a 1-dimensional domain (usually call time domain). That's why it's good at describing a parameterized closed curve, which are periodic functions and hence can also be considered to be function on a circle. This happens regardless of the dimension of the codomain, because any vector-valued functions can be decomposed into its scalar components. This decomposition result in what was known as ""epicycle"", by the way.

If you want to do so for a parameterized closed surface, you need a parameterized surface. But to use spherical harmonic, you need the surface to be parameterized by a sphere. But a lot of closed compact surface cannot be ""nicely"" parameterized by a sphere (the precise meaning is local diffeomorphism). The reason is topology: if you have such a nice parameterization, then it's local homeomorphism, and hence is a covering space. But many surface cannot be covered by a sphere, in fact there are only 2 such surfaces, up to topological equivalence: the sphere itself, and the projective plane. This significantly restrict its usefulness.

If your surface is indeed an embedding of a sphere or a projective plane, then yes, you can use it just fine.

Centroid are average point, taken with respect to uniform distribution on the length/area/volume.

Just to add, these ""blob"" that you see are pictures that represent magnitude in every direction.

Ebanflo,hjpanwn,"In 1 dimension, the second derivative operator is a linear operator whose eigenfunctions (infinite dimensional equivalent of eigenvectors) are sine functions. (the eigenvalues are the negative square frequencies, basically). If we restrict ourselves to a bounded interval, then we have a countable number of frequencies which can occur if the values of the function at the boundary must agree (constant, sin(x), cos(2x), cos(3x), etc). Algebraically, Fourier's theorem states that these eigenfunctions form a basis for all (square-)integrable functions on the interval.

We can also define a second derivative operator on different shapes besides the interval, though. This is called the Laplace-Beltrami operator and it essentially describes how extreme a value is relative to the values at nearby points. If we have a bounded (technically, compact) manifold, for example the sphere, it turns out the eigenfunctions of the Laplacd-Beltrami operator again form a basis for all functions. That's essentially how I think of the generalized Fourier theorem: the second derivative operator gives us an orthonormal (integral of each function is 1 and the integral of pairs of functions is 0) basis of functions which can be used to decompose any function into a bunch of components of differing frequencies.",10,How can I think of spherical harmonics intuitively?,raethalar,/r/math/comments/qoqos4/how_can_i_think_of_spherical_harmonics_intuitively/hjpanwn/,0.057,0.03,0.913,0.5542

Similarly, what spherical harmonics give you is a way to decompose functions from the sphere S^2 to R. If you have a closed surface*, you'll first have to parameterise it as a function from the S^2 to R^(3), then by splitting into coordinates you get three functions from S^2 to R, which you can then find the Fourier sums for.

*Furthermore, this surface needs to be homeomorphic to the sphere: there's no continuous map from a torus (surface of a doughnut) to a sphere! Now you can still decompose functions from the torus to R into sums like a Fourier series (the keyword is ""eigenfunctions of the Laplacian""), but harmonic analysis on general surfaces/smooth manifolds is a whole other can of worms.

Edit: On the centroid: for functions [0,2π] to R, the average value is just the constant coefficient in the Fourier series. Now the x-coordinate of the centroid of a given closed curve is the average value of the x-coordinates along the curve, so it's easy to read off if you have the Fourier series for the components. (The catch is that the parameterisation of the curve matters: the slower you're moving on the curve, the more mass is assigned to that part of the curve. So if you're thinking about the curve as made from a uniform wire, you'll have to make sure your curve is parameterised at constant speed.) The situation is exactly analogous for surfaces (but now you would need the map from S^2 to the surface to scale areas by the same amount at every point; I don't know how to construct such a map if I'm given a surface...).",23,How can I think of spherical harmonics intuitively?,raethalar,/r/math/comments/qoqos4/how_can_i_think_of_spherical_harmonics_intuitively/hjos6h2/,0.071,0.005,0.924,0.9655
BlanketSmoothie,hjpkmnh,"Let's say there are three people holding one end of a rope in their hands. The other end of the ropes are tied up in a knot. All move the rope up and down in the y,z plane. Person 1 at a times a second, persons 2 at b times a second, person 3 at c times a second.
Now, forget about the ropes and think about the knot, let's dip it in ink and unroll paper in contact with this knot at say 1 metre per second.
If we were to examine the plot that the inked knot makes on the paper, we would see some kind of repetitive pattern. If we applied a Fourier transform on this, we would see precisely three peaks at a, b and c in our frequency plot.
Now let's say the three people get bored of just moving it up and down and decide instead to rotate one end of the rope in their hand, with the other end still in a knot, now the knot is moving in 3 dimensions, again, forget about the ropes, look at the knot. Put the knot in a box with paper lined on the inside, on each plane you will have a projection of the superimposed 3 dimensional movement of three regular frequencies. Now, if your problem was to find the three components, how would you do it? In essence, the problem devolves to - how do you figure out what is happening in 3 dimensions from the 2 dimensional projections on the inside of box? By applying the Fourier transform on each of the projections independently ofcourse, they are after all independent planes. 
I hope this gives you a way to think about visualising Fourier transforms in 3 dimensions (you can even extend it to 4, say the rope is growing at some rate, what happens then to the knot at the end of the ropes?).",3,How can I think of spherical harmonics intuitively?,raethalar,/r/math/comments/qoqos4/how_can_i_think_of_spherical_harmonics_intuitively/hjpkmnh/,0.028,0.042,0.929,-0.5622

igLizworks,hjoqi27,"Basically yes, adding together a bunch of spherical harmonics will give you some surface in 3D just like how a Fourier series will give you some function. Some key things are that higher order spherical have more nodes so you can imagine when you add together a bunch of them you are adding together a bunch of sin waves with different frequency in the polar and azimuthal directions, scaled by functions of distance. However one can also imagine that since spherical harmonics have more degrees of freedom, to create some arbitrary shape will require a good deal of harmonics with specific coefficients. It’s good to imagine the coefficients as being complex rotations and scalings.

I don’t have any intuitive links or explanations at hand, but I think a lot of computer graphics people will have good visualizations of approximating some surface with spherical harmonics",3,How can I think of spherical harmonics intuitively?,raethalar,/r/math/comments/qoqos4/how_can_i_think_of_spherical_harmonics_intuitively/hjoqi27/,0.164,0.014,0.821,0.958
Steve132,hjq9uib,"I think part of the problem is that intuition of the fourier transform (the one where you use it to trace contours with circles) isn't really the best intuition to understand generalizations of the fourier transform like you're trying to do.

Instead, a much better intuition of the fourier transform for this context is to look at it as a linear combination of complex waves in one dimension.  Specifically, https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/50/Fourier_transform_time_and_frequency_domains.gif

So in that sense you can use a sequence of real waves to approximate a real function over a 1-d space, you can also use a sequence of real 2D waves to approximate a real function over a 2-D space.  (Think like a height map with f(x,y) )

So once you wrap your head around that (a 2d height map being represented as a sequence of 2D waves) then imagine that instead of it being a 2D Euclidean space, it's a 2D Mercator projection.

And that's basically what the spherical harmonics are:  2D basis functions defined on the surface of a sphere which allow you to approximate a 'terrain map' over a sphere with linear combinations.",1,How can I think of spherical harmonics intuitively?,raethalar,/r/math/comments/qoqos4/how_can_i_think_of_spherical_harmonics_intuitively/hjq9uib/,0.062,0.032,0.906,0.6157

Ebanflo,hjqz7zm,"The intuition of concavity from first semester calculus generalizes nicely. Essentially, the second derivative measures the rate of change of the rate of change at a point, so if you measure it at an optima it will tell you if it is a minimum or maximum, and in general it will tell you if you are in the region of a bowl or cap. The fact that sine/cosine are the eigenfunctions tells us that these functions might be defined as functions whose value at a point is proportional to the cap-ness or bowl-ness at that point.

That's also why it shows up in the diffusion equation: it measures how exaggerated a value is relative to its neighbors, and the second law of thermodynamics suggests that this should decrease with time.
