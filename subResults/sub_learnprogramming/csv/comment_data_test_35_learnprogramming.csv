justsomerandomchris,hjxzklt,"In this case, if you clearly define what the contents of the website should be, and how it should look, I would say that you're probably 1-2 months away from building it. It will mostly be HTML + CSS. For what you described, you don't even need any JS logic. Perhaps if you want to add some animations to make it feel more alive. But this is of course optional.

I'd recommend writing down some clear requirements (with the help of your father), start to build it, and just search for solutions whenever you get stuck at any step along the way. I think that you can already figure out the HTML part, but the styling will take you some time to get right (especially if you also want to make it responsive).

i_do_it_all,hjyr9y9,"defining requirements, separating concerns and learning version control will definitely make you a better developer.   


However, i strongly encourage to make it more complex SPA compared to HTML/CSS as you won't learn anything transferable in the process. No IRL projects are that simple. I think it is important learn some framework is important here.   


I think OP is putting his future also on this project. as a result it should be something he can show future employer. No-one will be impressed with HTML / CSS. a simple HTML/CSS may even discourage someone from hiring you as they will see that you did not make a dynamic web-site. It is a poor reflection on intention of developer.  


 However a basic React app will help him a lot as it will show his competency.   


Again , Do not hard code shit. I usually reject engineers from interview if i see magic numbers or hard-coded data ( except -test ) . it is just bad practice.   


If you are trying to be a developer, focus on becoming a reasonable one. Don't cut corners. It is also important learn some back-end.

Thanks for your kind words of encouragement and advice! Well in regards to being under pressure, I'm not really in a very stressful job (but that's a double-edged sword because the lack of action is what is killing me here, I want a job that makes me THINK and solve problems). My daily activities usually include designing stuff with photoshop, taking pictures and annotating them with photoshop, and other graphic design stuff. The company does not employ google ads or any PPC marketing strategy mainly because their line of business is very niche specific (we sell primarily marine transmissions and other industrial equipment) and our country is very small (ie. a small market). So we do not work with a lot of data, to be honest. It's a very old-school type of company tbh. 

I was thinking of finishing the python 3 course and then taking the data science career path? It seems very interesting and I have always loved math and algebra (numbers in general really). I'm also a fan of automation and artificial intelligence. I know most people here say Codecademy holds too much your hand but I feel they are great for me because I learn much more by active practice than by long boring lectures tbh.

For me, the process looks like this:

1) I get familiar a bit with a new PL (let's talk about a new programming language) by reading books or tutorials (or watching, doesn't really matter). They are usually overwhelming and 80% of the information is just the next day. But it's okay. What I need to know at this stage is just what this PL can, what can't, and how I'd achieve what it can.

2) After tutorials are done, I start a project, a little one, but I have a clear understand what it should look like. Being stuck on every step forces me to look into the documentation, tutorials, Stackoverflow and any other resources.

3) After finishing the project, start another project, more complicated, finish it.

I generally tell people learn to program, then we'll see about the rest.  I generally advise Python because it's a little easier to get started.  I'm more used to Java, but it can get verbose.  And more than likely, you'll pick up a second language at some point.

And you're probably going to get a lot of advice to go this direction or that.  I generally don't look at goals (it's nice to have, to be sure) because it's not even clear whether you learn to program or not.  I know that's kinda harsh, but people's expectation is ""anyone who spends this amount of time will reach their goals"", but people have gotten frustrated and quit, often to try again and quit.

Hopefully, you don't run into that problem, but self-teaching is a bit of work.  I'm told ""Automate the Boring Stuff"" is a good book on Python (it's free online somewhere).

BakaPotatoLord,hjyya2u,"1. I don't really understand what you mean, how the for loop knows what charmap has? It's because charmap is declared right outside of the for loop but inside the function so charmap is also in scope of for loop.

2. You are using the index value itself as the key in the second code. It's supposed to be charMap[str[i]]",2,For Of/Map Question,thetacocoder,/r/learnprogramming/comments/qqapye/for_ofmap_question/hjyya2u/,0.05,0.0,0.95,0.4767
insertAlias,hjyyl19,">How does for loop know what's in Charmap

I don't understand the question. You declared `charMap` as a variable, so it knows what's in there because it's a variable that's in scope, like any other variable.

>What would the old syntax look like for this?

First, it's not necessarily _old_ syntax; it's just the standard `for` loop.

But in this context, it would be pretty simple to replicate the `for...of` functionality in a simple `for`.

You'd just add `const char = str[i];` as the first line, and the rest of the code from the original example would be the same. 

`for...of` loops over an iterable collection and assigns each entry to the range variable at each iteration. So when you do this:

    for(let char of str)

You are saying ""`char` is going to be set to each character from my string as the loop iterates"".

When you write a for loop:

    for(let i = 0; i < str.length, i++)

You are saying ""`i` is going to be set to a number, starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, until it is bigger than `str.length`"".

Sometimes there just isn't enough Seniors to go around, either because the company is growing really quick or they weren't good enough at training/keeping the newcomers till they reach senior level.

If that's the hand you'r dealt you kinda have to just roll with it, maybe seek help amongst your peers, and maybe checkup with the higher ups what the culture is about reviews/mentoring, and if they tell you that the seniors time just is very sparse, you'll just have to be more independent in this organization, and they will appreciate that.You can also try and ask for help in a very unitrusive way like: ""Hey, i'm really struggling with something, if i could get five minutes of your time at some point today it would really be appreciated"", and if they get around to you, great!

lordcat,hjugdla,"> With very few, case by case, exceptions.

Far too often I've seen the most senior member of the team make a small innocent little change that has come back to cause major problems.

If you're in that much of a rush that you don't have time for a review, then it's critical that you get it reviewed (because you certainly don't have time for the mess that not reviewing it can cause).

If it's that small of a change that it doesn't need code review, then the code review should be quick and easy for someone else to check out that small minor change.

There is never a good reason not to code review a change in code that will go to production.",41,"As a junior, am I selfish to expect a little help or code reviews at the end of the story?",RainnMake,/r/learnprogramming/comments/qpd911/as_a_junior_am_i_selfish_to_expect_a_little_help/hjugdla/,0.057,0.076,0.867,-0.3609

Sen√µr dev does no code review at all

Sen√µr dev merges my branch where I had accidentally changed file permissions. Does note that a lot of file has changed but still presses le button.

Production is fcked. 

Somehow I am responsible but no one says it straight.

After several other attempts at fixing the production branch Revert to 5 commits earlier

Lose all confidence I ever had.

Not merging anything to master or even asking for it again. 

Ask if it would be possible to cherry pick files from branches to avoid event's like this. Answer is that there isn't time for that.

FastFuriousGeorge,hjv0g4p,"If the most that's being requested is 20 minutes of time then that's not too much. A junior dev should NEVER be left to float without assistance. In a recent but former life I was a supervisor for Junior devs and they got crap all the time from more experienced people and management because things weren't exactly as they expected. In reality those devs just needed a little time. When I became their supervisor I gave them what I could of my time and basically forced the time needed with senior devs. It made tons of difference.

ZukoBestGirl,hjy0juh,"Oh man, I could write a book on my first real software dev job. If I added one of my friends, we could make a trilogy on bad management. I think it could, if done right, read like a tragic comedy.

TL;DR in a country where the minimum monthly salary only recently hit 700$, we had a multi million dollar project on a local company. So not some sort of multi national corp. Big part of the income right there.

It was 1 senior dev at 100% capacity, an architect at like 20%, and a bunch of junior devs with less than 2 years XP.

At some point, BOTH SENIOR DEVS LEFT. They had to promote some mid devs, pretend that they're senior, give them a bunch of responsability that they were not prepared for, and call it a day.

On paper, we had code review. Lemme tell you how that went. You'd do a user story. You'd push your code, regardless of review, on the main branch. BECAUSE THAT'S JUST HOW SVN WORKS. Then you give your ticket to your supervisor to review. Then he would put the story into complete. 

No, I didn't skip a step. It was his responsibility to move the ticket from ""under review"" to ""complete"" and nothing else. Okay, he also did the releases, and distributed tasks such as bugs and the such. 

Reviewing code is not something he ever did.",1,"As a junior, am I selfish to expect a little help or code reviews at the end of the story?",RainnMake,/r/learnprogramming/comments/qpd911/as_a_junior_am_i_selfish_to_expect_a_little_help/hjy0juh/,0.052,0.045,0.903,0.453

ZukoBestGirl,hjy7ezz,"I absolutely agree, 100%. I have a story on this subject, but it's a bit long. 

I had worked at a very toxic workplace. Veeery toxic. We had no code review. We had ""rockstar devs"" ... who just so happened to be juniors.

How are you a rockstar junior dev? You get shit done. Fast. Doesn't matter if it actually works. If you can trick people that it works, that's enough. If it breaks something else, that's not the task in question. Just - get - shit - done!

It was a hellhole.

But as luck would have it, we downsized, and those ""rockstars"" were reassigned. Still, our whole structure and process was just as bad. 

I felt myself stagnate. That being said, I'm pretty good at what I do, I always have been. But still, the lack of experience was blatantly visible. 

But then, a strange series of events happened. I was doing a ""code review"". As in, a colleague did a really cool implementation of something we've been dreading for a long time, and he found a generic solution. At that place of work, generic was a buzzword. A magic incantation. Read: Not reality, but aspirational. And the dude actually made an abstract generic implementation that actually works. I wanted to see how he did it. So, this wasn't a code review. This was what my supervisor would call ""slacking off"", but in a nice, passive aggressive, corporate way. 

Another colleague wanted to call me out in a break. But this dude is a bit of a trickster. So instead of calling me, he stood behind me, and waited for me to notice him. And kept coming closer and closer till I'd finally notice him. Except I never did. He wanted to see what I was so invested in that I wasn't paying any attention. And the code was so well written, even he caught on. He didn't even know what I was looking at. Just that it looked very well written. We started talking about this other guy's implementation. 

Now, you should know. Dude #3 was an oddball. No one really liked him. Came off strong, a bit obnoxious. So, I was totally praising his code. Literally gushing all over it. Audibly because now I was talking to guy #2 (I'm guy #1 in this story). I tell guy #2 that he should NEVER tell guy #3 I said all that nice stuff about his code. NEVER! And, sometimes, life imitates art. Guy #3 comes in and says ""Don't tell who hat?""

TL;DR - we end up laughing about the whole thing, went on a longer smoke break on the roof of the building. And we start talking very seriously about good code and code review. We were all comepltely upset about everything. Guy #3 said he also saw some really good code I wrote, and that's where he got the idea for his thing. I tell him that even so, his thing was just better written, we both compliment guy #2 about some of the stuff he made. 

And we decided there and there: Even if the company doesn't do code review, we will. That kinda turned into the best year of programming in my life. Though maybe not a full year, cuz they both ended up leaving the company. But that simple thing of reviewing eachother's code. Asking ""but why did you did it that way?"" and suggesting things the other didn't even consider. It helped a lot.


------------------------

Even to this day, I haven't been through the proper process of code review, other than those few months. These days we do code review.
