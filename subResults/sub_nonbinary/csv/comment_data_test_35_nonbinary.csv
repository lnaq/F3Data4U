roywillgibuk,hjxyih4,"Hey first off we have got you.

Is it that you want a binary gender that isn't there? I think being NB is owning that instability to create a stability. For example, realising that I can shop all over the clothes store and the only limit is my own style is pretty big. 

Name, time to an extent. All names sound odd until they are used commonly, if you ever name a child you'll see this life go from 'bump' to ""Alex"" and it only starts to become lodged in your head after a few days of saying the name on repeat 16 million times.

Is that helpful?",26,I feel like nothing and I don’t want to.,stereolights,/r/NonBinary/comments/qq5hpd/i_feel_like_nothing_and_i_dont_want_to/hjxyih4/,0.085,0.02,0.895,0.755

 Whenever I try to enter an NB space everyone is so fixated on their own demi, agab, man/women, etc, won't stop talking about their genitals, I'm always like fuck maybe I am in the wrong place again. I feel like am getting shouted over before I can start talking half the time. 

Hell, I posted asking asking middle name help, left it up a week and got zero response. I gave up and took it down.

kaikempeweidenbaum,hjy1r5s,"Same here for masculinity (I am amab). I am relatively sure that I am no woman, either though I hope I will know once I actually start HRT. Though I do not mind either my name nor the pronouns commonly used for me. I find it reassuring to, at least temporarily describe myself using negatives like agender and nonbinary. But expressing my gender and being percieved as androgynous (which can also be a identity btw) is the goal I am going for right now. Maybe I discover I am actually a woman once I am on hormones and if not I may get some clarity about what I actually am. But who knows? 

What I know is, that the core of masculinity is basically non-femininity. But there are recent constructs like caring or soft masculinities that integrate feminine traits into male role concepts. So it is really hard to dismantle what actually is at the core of masculinity and it is very loaded with power dynamics and structures. I think it may help you to try and dig through that to get a clearer picture what of your perception of gender is genuine and what might be internalised misogyny and/or self -hatred blurring the pictures.

I hope this kind of helps?!? I wish you all the best :)",14,I feel like nothing and I don’t want to.,stereolights,/r/NonBinary/comments/qq5hpd/i_feel_like_nothing_and_i_dont_want_to/hjy1r5s/,0.178,0.037,0.785,0.9883

GioDoodicus,hjynfmy,"I'm NB here, AMAB though so i can't relate one-to-one, but I've had a similar experience. 

What i can say is, if you're not so tight on money to the point where you struggle to pay food/bills *and* afford stuff you just like, you should definitely consider a binder for the time being, see how you like it. Many transmascs and AFAB NBs I've talked to said they loved getting top surgery, but depending on where you live it can take an annoyingly long time, so why not keep using the binder until then?

And you've mentioned therapy, that's definitely something that can be useful. If you trust your therapist enough to tell them you identify as NB (if you haven't told them already) they can help you out. Not just with your emotions obvs but also, depending on where you live, your therapist can cover some portion of the bills for top surgeries and/or HRT (if you ever consider that).

So basically, binder is a definite yes if you can afford, top surgery is a question you'll have to answer for yourself

And no, you shouldn't live your entire life pretending to be cis and/or in a body you don't like. Life's too short to be spent living a deliberate lie.

Chaotic_Nonbinary,hjytriz,"I’m nonbinary, and I felt really similarly at your age (all of 2 years ago). Sometimes it takes time to figure your gender and dysphoria stuff out, and while it may be uncomfortable or distressing to not know, it’s alright and completely normal.

With the binder stuff, you can definitely start out small. Maybe start with a compression bra (or whatever you’re comfy with), the Under Armor one has worked really well for me, but it depends on your body type. 

I also felt very intimidated (and intrigued) by the idea of binding. And I was really dumb with binding when I started out.

And the general rule of thumb to binding is to take breaks, listen to your body. Never bind with tape, not transtape either.
Bind for no longer than 8 hours total a day and take at least 1-2 days off binding a week. 
Also, ppl can’t usually start out binding by binding 8 hours a day, day 1. Build up to that if that’s something you want to do.
Stretch after you take a binder off, cough a couple times. 
These guidelines go for all kinds of binders, official and diy. 
Here’s a good video:

And there are tons more available on YouTube. Really good companies are (there are more than this, these are just the ones off the top of my head):
•gc2b
•shapeshifters 

I know, from experience,  at gc2b you can ask for help with the sizing. There’s a size chart and some charts showing you how to measure. If they suggest a size that’s too small, you ship the too small one back to them and they ship you a size up, no charge.


And it might not feel like it, but there’s time to figure out how you want to deal with dysphoria. It helped me a lot to talk about it with my therapist. 

And know that there are tons of different ways to physically transition if that’s something you decide you’re interested in. 

If you want to transition (in any way, socially, physically, etc.) do what makes you comfortable on your own time frame. And know that everyone’s journey looks different. You don’t have to find a label if you don’t want to, or do if you do. Even if it’s a microlabel or multiple labels or just nonbinary as the umbrella term it is. 
Any age you figure it out isn’t too old or too young and this stuff is difficult. 

I’m happy for you and honestly proud of you. Asking questions is hard. 

I hope you have a great day!",1,NB Advice? Young and stupid please assist.,LegitAshBullet,/r/NonBinary/comments/qq8h21/nb_advice_young_and_stupid_please_assist/hjytriz/,0.111,0.056,0.833,0.9816
LegitAshBullet,hjyspus,I'm switching therapists right now and I think the next one I get definitely needs to know and talk me through this because I am a mess. But what you said about life being too short to live a lie is really reassuring. I need to do something about how I feel. Thank you,2,NB Advice?

LegitAshBullet,hjyt7qz,"Yeah it being a wider term was something my friend had to get me to see, I'm really happy it is because the term non binary is something I love. I'm happy it's a generally accepting bunch or at least from what been around. I need to try both the sports bra and binder I guess and see which one feels better. Thank you.",1,NB Advice?
