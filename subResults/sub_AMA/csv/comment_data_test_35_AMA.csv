---------|----------|----------|
That's awesome! Congrats! :)  Favorite Price is Right game?  Also, favorite kind of cheese?|I liked Super Ball (retired 1998) but current favorite game besides Plinko (which I missed by $2 overbid) is Cliffhangers or Rat Race or Punch a Bunch.  Cheese! Probably Colby Jack|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwkz0n/)
I just went over to the CBS tab on the Paramount app to watch you win. Congrats!  Do you live near water?  Was that filmed in the same Price Is Right studio that it's always been filmed in? I was there back in the 90's. That looks tiny compared to what I remember!|It’s the exact same studio, renamed the Bob Barker studios in 1998.  Yes I live near both the ocean and near a man made lake.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwk60h/)
When do you get the prizes|You don’t receive anything until your show airs. The first thing I received today was the Armani sunglasses and scarf. The rest of the items will be in the next few weeks to months depending on supply chain and other factors like when we take the trip.  Taxes are due on things like boats and cars.  All prizes are also taxed as personal income|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwj013/)
How do you plan to pay the taxes on the boat?|I have a moderately successful travel business selling Disney vacations and can afford to pay the taxes. If I was in my 20s, I would have to ask family or would sell it back to dealership I guess to pay the tax bill and keep the leftover.  I just was in this for the experience as a lifelong fan of the show.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwmr3s/)
do you have an option to trade prizes for cash if you cant pay the taxes on em? thats always been a curious part for me on the show|Nope. You have 7 days to forfeit the prizes if you don’t want or can’t afford the tax liability. There is no cash equivalent option.  Some games include cash prizes of course like Plinko.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwoc93/)
Congratulations! I love that you got to do that, especially as a lifelong fan.  For the trip, are the dates already set, or can you choose a time that works best for you?|You choose a series of dates and they give it to a travel company to arrange. The production team are super nice and treat you like family even though they work really long days and are probably exhausted (final taping of day for us and they do 3 in a day)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwwzjd/)
First of all, congratulations! 🍾🎉 I have a few questions for you, if you don’t mind! ☺️  1. Where does one go to apply to be on these fun game shows?  2. Did it take a long time before finding out whether or not you were eligible to be on the show? How long was your experience?  3. Any advice for those of us who want to apply?  4. Are you able to make payments or work out an arrangement with the IRS regarding the prize taxes or is it all due at once, no exceptions?|1. Priceisright.com - complete the application and if they like you, I think they will contact you for the next step. This season is a little different because normally you just get tickets to a taping and show up. Apply and let me know how it goes! Once on the show (contestants row), you are ineligible for 10 years to go to contestants row but I can still be an audience member and if I have nothing to do, I’ll go for moral support. Must be Vax and you will also get tested 1-2 days prior.  2. About 2-4 weeks after applications was the first contact and then 2-3 weeks later got invited to a taping. The taping took awhile. Arrived at 3:30pm for a 4pm taping And I think we didn’t get in the studio until 4:30pm and didn’t exit until 7:30pm+.  3. Be yourself but also be energetic. They love loyal fans and if you love the games, show it! This is TV so you need to be energetic and ready to play. They do pick from the audience and would you want to pick someone who is quiet, shy even when the cameras aren’t on them?  4. I’m not sure but I would imagine the taxes due on vehicles and such are non negotiable. Due to receive. Get a family member to help becsuse a vehicle can always be sold and you still come out ahead. Trips you don’t pay taxes until after you take the trip and you pay it on the following years personal income tax at your rate so you have time for that! In that regard, you can use all available options with IRS regarding your taxes including extensions. Not an accountant so this is a good question to ask a tax professional. If a prize has good value like a car, keep it no matter what. If it is a trip, you’ll owe quite a bit but you also have lots of time for taxes.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjxil5u/)
Oh man, you sound like someone I need to help plan a trip.|Aw thanks. I love Disney and Universal and making memories for all types of families and couples. The best part is my service is free as Disney bakes it into the prices whether you get help from an authorized planner or not. Hit me up when ready.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjwp504/)
What is Showcase? What is ""price is right""?|It’s a game show that has been on in America for 50 years 5 days a week. It’s a game where people get picked from the audience to play pricing games where knowing prices or everyday items like groceries can win you big prizes like trips, cars, and boats.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjxkw0e/)
Wow! Congratulations!! I only know of the show vicariously through American TV shows who reference it but it looks wild! What part of Ireland are you going to? Do you plan it yourself or do they provide you with an itinerary?|Cork and they plan the airfare and hotel only. The rest is up to you how you spend your time.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjxkx8w/)
Are you taking the boat to Ireland?|Haha this boat is not made for the ocean.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjxlhda/)
How was Drew doing off camera?  He had a rough go the last few years.|Didn’t get much time with him due to Covid, but he was fun, affable during taping and during breaks. Making jokes and talking to audience. Felt like a family reunion was where you don’t really know all the family but you know everyone has your back.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qpwmzb/i_won_the_showcase_on_the_price_is_right_today_ama/hjxm42n/)

It hurt my business a lot and was tough to cancel so many trips. So much work went unpaid and so many memories for my clients crushed.

WithDisGuy,hjxydsg,"I believe these answers are tricky. If you have grit and are willing to fail, I believe anyone can start anything but the time it takes to grow something and understand what the work really is….often under underestimated. Branding, customer acquisition, and being on-call to demands of clients can still be stressful and difficult. Plus the money doesn’t start coming in until they complete their trip and it’s not much. You also need to establish a few legal/logistical things like a host agency who takes a cut, E&O insurance, and in some cases, your own LLC and regulatory frameworks such as Sellers of Travel license plus training for Disney and Universal and any vendors you want to offer. 

I keep things small on things I am an expert in and enjoy discussing.

WithDisGuy,hjxzu4r,"Yes! I can see how this might cause some stress, but for us it’s twofold:

I legitimately went in just wanting the experience. My bucket list was attend taping, get to contestants row, play Plinko, spin the wheel and win, win showcase. I did everything on that list except Plinko and was a $2 overbid away from playing that!

I never went in for prizes.  I just wanted to experience it. I knew about taxes going in and it wasn’t going to bug me. I wanted to play! Sometimes you just want to feel alive, feel the adrenaline. In that regard, everything was met x 100 and it was unforgettable. Yes, winning helped. Losing my game earlier in the show also helped because I realized it didn’t really matter then and was able to just enjoy myself.  

As for the prizes I won, it’s a no brainer even if I was financially strapped. We are comfortable but a boat has real value as a hard asset to sell if we wanted to “cash it out” in a private sale or back to dealer if they are amicable. The gold is same as cash really and can be sold for a little less than spot price. I got a good showcase tbh. 

I can’t imagine how an 18 year old handles this, but I would guess they get family members to help out. I know of one friend who won a car and she sold it back to dealer for a few thousand less than what the show paid, paid off taxes, and came out about $14,000 ahead after income tax.

Why do you think all the questions in the thread are getting downvoted|No idea I just woke up so my cognitive skills are still waking up|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjypxdr/)
Why did you put religion in quotation marks?|Because I don’t like to think about it as a religion. For my people it was never a religion it was who we were it’s a lifestyle rather than some kind of organized religion it’s just who we are|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjyovbp/)
do you know why native-american  men used to pluck out all their facial hair,including eyebrows,but had long hair?|Haha this is the first I’ve ever received this type of questIon. We naturally don’t have facial hair, me I’m Blackfoot and cree with a dash of German I couldn’t get a moustache if I wanted to (believe me I’ve tried) the best I’m gonna get in some peach fuzz|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjypzog/)
I'd love to learn more about indigenous cultures! Do you recommend any books, videos, or people to look towards? How are you today? What do you believe in?|Really depends on what specific native group you want to read on, for example I’m Blackfoot I couldn’t recommend books if your trying to read on Navajo or Paiute. But I’m good thanks for asking. We believe in many things but the main few would be, napi (old man), naato’si (holy one), Apistotoke (great spirit), Sspommitapiiksi (sky people)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjyuff4/)
What do you believe?|Elaborate. Like gods? Or|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjxhfri/)
How do you hold that so many Native Americans are Christians? Does it bother you, or do you have a different perspective? It is something that has always perplexed me.|Yes it bothers me greatly, it’s like a Jew turning nazi because the nazis said they were superior to the Jews, which they did. For us it was a slower killing. The motto of residential schools is “kill the Indian, save the man”. I’ll truly never understand how someone can believe a religion so hateful especially to your specific group. Christianity plays a big part in our genocide and for my people to say “god is who created me” is something that I will never understand. I have a strong hatred for the church, but my mom and grandma raised me to respect everyone’s beliefs. I have a few friends who are Christians but I’ve never preached to them or pushed my ways because that’s not my choice, if they ask me about it I’d gladly tell them about it but it’s up to them.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjysaou/)
Why do you keep responding to my first question and then deleting your response right away?|Mmm I’m not I only replied once|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjyvs7t/)
Which Native American group/tribe?|Kainai blood tribe (Blackfoot)|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjy45nw/)
I don’t know if you ever played red dead redemption 2, but what are your thoughts on how the situation with the natives were portrayed?|Love the game, I really liked, it it showed how isolated we were from towns or even civilization. On my reserve, up until the 60-mid 70’s we couldn’t leave the Rez without having permission from the “Indian agent” it was very strict too. Let’s say you left to get eggs, bread, milk, and some meat. If you came back with something extra like some apples that weren’t on the list, often times they were taken or destroyed. Another thing I liked is the portrayal of eagle flies and rains fall, the two are a great representation of our elderly and our youth. The youth constantly try and help and make our reserves better but often times it ends up backfiring, the elderly constantly trying to guide us younger ones but there are a lot that choose not to listen. Rains falls teachings on persistence with patience are a core value of my people. Everything takes time but you have to fight through the long battles.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjxhg62/)
What religion is that??|It’s my people’s religion before the church and everything|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq2own/im_native_american_and_i_follow_my_traditional/hjxfznk/)

You need to pay for driving test???|hell yes and its a fuckton of money. if had got it would have paid for the whole training and theory lessons and for the two tests themselves roughly 1.2 k euros. since i failed i have to pay another 240 euros only for the test itself.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq1xx2/just_failed_my_drivers_license_test_ama/hjy8n72/)
Did you exhibit any form(s) of road rage in your practise run?|no, i am glad so. i made the mistake that is why i failed.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qq1xx2/just_failed_my_drivers_license_test_ama/hjxcw13/)

I've learned a lot about the psychology behind it and how people use disinformation to manipulate people, which I find repugnant. It was really cemented when I recently had to write an essay for uni about it and all the research I did helped make all this stuff really clear and now it seems so obvious. Also watching my sister (who is still really brainwashed) losing all her friends and family and becoming completely isolated but digging her heels in further made me see what I was like and I hated it.",12,I used to be a conspiracy theory nut.

totalthrowaway0000,hjxr3sb,"Oh boy, lots of things! Definitely that it's not just stupid people who believe them. Not to talk myself up but I think I'm pretty smart generally, I'm a university honours student and I have a lot of interests. I should have had the critical skills to be able to see that the information I was looking at was not trustworthy but it aligned so well with how I felt (and still feel to some degree) about the world and other people that it was irresistible. 

That's another thing, people who fall for this stuff tend to be very isolated and sad and misanthropic. There is a whole community around conspiracy theories that gives people something that they are lacking in their lives but the ostracisation makes that much worse. 

Also, in my research I saw some discussion about the relationship between PTSD and conspiracy theory engagement, which totally makes sense to me. Trauma makes you anxious and distruful of others, which contributes to this assumption of nefarious motive. So I guess I want people to know that if someone is talking about conspiracy theories it could be a sign that they are really hurting or legitimately unwell. I know I really was. It's a terrifying way of seeing the world and conspiracists really do need kindness and help to feel at least a little bit ok about being alive.

One more thing: there really are some horrifying conspiracies that have occurred so dismissing theories outright because they seem outlandish isn't necessarily a good thing.

Also maybe point out how easy it is for bad actors to use disinformation to manipulate people. I know when someone said to me (and I know they were joking but it shook me a little when I heard it) that conspiracy theories are being churned out by China and Russia to create discord it made me question things a little.

DistinctBook,hjzak00,"As in rather than listen to people talk about other peoples cultures, I go out and research them. Of course, I will listen to native speakers.  
  
The one I went in Chicago was incredible. It was all the plains tribes gather together and had to be the largest pow-wow I have been to. Many of the people were dressed up in their native attire and they were open to answer questions about them.  
  
There were people talking about their culture and they had a lot of art works for sale.   
  
This one man was selling mandala’s and it is plains Indian dance shield and medicine wheel. It impressed me so much that I bought one. He explained all the parts to it. Sadly I wished I had written them down as in now I have forgotten them.  
  
I had put this into storage as in I traveled a lot. Finally when I pulled it out of storage, I had found the feathers had fallen apart.   
  
So I started to look around for where I could replace them and found a few internet sites that sell Indian crafts and supplies. I had replaced them with turkey feathers but soon I am going to replace them with long black turkey vulture feathers.   
  
Now looking in the catalog I saw beaded medallions, porcupine quills and horse hair. So I am thinking take a beaded medallion and surround it with colored porcupine quills and behind it put horse hair in the circular pattern. I made three of these in a various size and mounted them on the wall.   
  
Someone asked me where did I get them? I told them it was a local artist Joef Proudfoot made them but he is very shy and reclusive",1,I’m native american. (Apache and part Hopi) AMA,damienandrewss,/r/AMA/comments/qq66l6/im_native_american_apache_and_part_hopi_ama/hjzak00/,0.007,0.04,0.953,-0.8397

Whether it was when someone was showing happiness or sadness, I am just completely unable to feel anything towards them. Thats when I first realised there was something different about me. But, the earliest signs I had were as a child I used to be very aggressive, impulsive and antisocial, duh. Also, appropriate behaviour and a lack of morality. I would suggest looking out for those things, but dont jump into conclusions. Maybe even try to talk to him or your parents! Best wishes|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjvitbk/)
Do you fold your pizza when you eat it?|I dont like pizza|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjviwx7/)
What led to your diagnosis? Was there an incident or was it just something that happened?|It was actuallt just me opening up to a therapist I trusted. I have been going to different therapists since I was 4 and only last year I trusted one of them enough to actually open up. I told him everything about how I was feeling and he suspected aspergers at first too|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjvtnrp/)
What is ASPD? I never heard of that. Do not know much about clinical psychiatric  diagnoses.|ASPD stands for Antisocial Personality Disorder!|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjvijg5/)
What kinds of music do you like?|Honestly a little bit of everything. I do listen to a lot of indie rock|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjvprt5/)
What was your favorite subject in school?|None. I hated school. All of it.|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjvs2vp/)
Is it possible for you to become “close” with others e.g. emotional connection  Are you more concerned with the practical benefits of something, or whether or not it’s fun? e.g. picking a hobby that benefits you as opposed to picking one such as video games that’s just for fun|Interesting question. I do certainly feel love, just differently. I do feel connected to some people in a way that ir sorr of becomes like a dependency on each other and it doesnt end well. I used to have friends, I dont anymore because I neglected them and treated them poorly until one day they snapped. I havent heard from them in months. So Id say yes, I can become attached but Im not sure if I can love. And about hobbies well. I dont have a lot of hobbies. I am a pilot and thats something I enjoy but ultimately I picked that because I know it is useful. I dont usuallt waste time on stuff that doesnt give me something back. I rarely play video games|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjw6wgv/)
[deleted]|Hmm well. Not all people w ASPD are the same but in my case I did try to hurt or intentionally intimidate people. Back when I was younger my response to almost everything was violence. the older I got the more I realised this is not a good way to handle things and itll usually get me in trouble. And I wouldnt want trouble for myself. What makes you think hes trying to hurt you? Has he threatened you?|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjvym6m/)
Do you get enjoyment from your personal life experience?  Just because you're not sharing in the emotions of others does that necessarily mean you have bad intentions towards others?  If you do have bad thoughts is it possible to disagree with those thoughts?  The reason I ask is because I feel that many people would fit in this category to a lesser degree with the small differences of truly empathizing with a few close individuals. I think many people pretend to care in order to fulfill social norms in order to maintain a social order that ultimately benefits everyone. Would you agree?|No. I dont get much our of it. I dont have friends. No one wants to talk to me. I only genuinely enjoy the company of my boyfriend and sometimes he loses his worth completely to me. My personal life sociallt is boring. when im not flying a plane Im working on something else completely alone. most of the time. I do have friends, yes, but only people who have to see me everyday. A very superficial type of friendship that only consists on having fun togerher to pass time. And no, I don’t necessarily enjoy hurting people. Back then it was all about getting what I wanted and god help heal the damage I had done. I have hurt people to a point where they beg if I recognise them on the street I dont say a word to them. But i regret that. In my sense of morality, exploiting people is not okay. At least like I use to exploit them. I do not talk to anyone if I dont want something out of them, whether thatd be harmless entertainment or something deeper.  I have a hard time recognising bad thoughts or bad actions most of thw time. Thats one of the reasons my former friends cut me off. But ir generally goes like this If i do thing > I will get in trouble > trouble is NOT good for ME. thats how I manage to recognise if Im being bad And I agree 100%. We all lie in a way to get what we want. To get along with a boss so we can get a promotion. We fake interest. But I have never felt these genuine emotions towards anyone|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjw6zhy/)
Do you make any attempt to blend in with ""normal"" people behavior or don't you see value in the effort of faking emotion?  Have you ever had a relationship? If yes, how did it go, if no, would you like to?|Hey. Yes I am constantly blending in with the crowd! 24/7 it takes a lot of mental effort to “mask” and pretend ro be neurotypical. Sometimes it slips and theres little fuck ups, but most of the time no one can really tell. Im smart, Im a correct nice guy if you get to know me. Im polite too. Sometimes I have bad days and “unmask”. I just dont talk ro people or ignore them. I dont bother to fake emotion ans I just sound very monotone, but i try to avoid it because it can draw attention. Also, I had 3 relationships in my life. My first ex begged me to never contact him again after 2 years of relationship and 2 years of friendship. He called me a monster and pretty much said he was terrified of me. I do regret this. I dont like to hurt people. My second partner lasted 9 months. It was better, they just lost interest in me. And my current boyfriend and I have been togerher for 9 months, weve had a lot of issues but generally things go well. I can be a bit dependant on him sometimes ans hes also the only person I talk to. I am possessive ans incredibly jealous but I have managed to somewhat control these feelings|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjw8653/)
If you could would you change? Even though i think its not possible for a psychopath to change (idk sorry).|I cant change. My brain is wired this way. Its different. You can look up scans! I dont understand all that very well but I am aware its a part of my brain that is not properly functional. Its a neurodivergence|[Here](/r/AMA/comments/qprl1t/i_am_a_psychopath_i_have_aspd_ama/hjw8rku/)

And no, I don’t necessarily enjoy hurting people. Back then it was all about getting what I wanted and god help heal the damage I had done. I have hurt people to a point where they beg if I recognise them on the street I dont say a word to them. But i regret that. In my sense of morality, exploiting people is not okay. At least like I use to exploit them. I do not talk to anyone if I dont want something out of them, whether thatd be harmless entertainment or something deeper.

I have a hard time recognising bad thoughts or bad actions most of thw time. Thats one of the reasons my former friends cut me off. But ir generally goes like this 
If i do thing > I will get in trouble > trouble is NOT good for ME. thats how I manage to recognise if Im being bad

Tuliao_da_Massa,hjzayku,"Mine as well, so I'd say don't worry. 

Being a good person isn't a matter of what you feel or don't feel. It's ultimately a matter of effort. People think they're incredibly moral, until that morality requires the bare minimum of sacrifice. Then they either completely ignore morality, or think that ""It's just one time"".

I'll give you a very personal example, which I'm not at all implying you're immoral for not following. 

I don't drink. Not because I don't like the taste, or because of my health, but because I think it's despicably wrong. I believe it ruins the world. But that belief ruins a lot of potencial relationships I could have had. It ruins a lot of fun I could have experienced. I'm not saying I'm the messiah of morality, but that is quite a big sacrifice I make, especially at my age, in order to do what I think is right, and that decision came from hours upon hours of research and careful thought.

Most, if not all, of the time people commit immoral actions, big or small, they're in all likelyhood not caring. Not putting the effort. Not giving a shit. That's the line between good and bad. Conscious effort. 

And by what you're saying, I can tell you put at least a good amount of effort when deciding if something is right or wrong. I've had people being angry at me for thinking alcohol is wrong. And I've had people not like me because of it. So if you're worried about morality, my friend, you're a good person in my book.",1,I am a psychopath. I have ASPD.
