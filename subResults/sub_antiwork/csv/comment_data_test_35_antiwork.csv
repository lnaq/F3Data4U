thatsnoprobllama,hjz8386,"My brother got Covid last year because of a coworker coming to work with Covid and not telling anyone until after their shift.

And it was all because of an ignorant coworker of my brother’s.

If this is legitimate, then you need to do more than just tell OSHA. You need to contact a news station, post it on Twitter, FB, Insta, anywhere you can - anonymously if you don’t feel safe - to let people know to stay away from that store and to spread the word, because people WILL die or have life-long complications from this if you don’t. 

If this isn’t legitimate, then shame on you for being so attention-seeking. I had a family member and a very close mentor/friend die of Covid, and many more find themselves in the hospital on ventilators after getting the Delta variant.

Stuff like this is why Republicans were trying so hard to protect businesses, because they didn't want them to get sued when they knowingly and willingly let sick employees work and get others sick...it's not negligence, not an accident. Forcing them to work is just malicious.

Thankfully that didn't pass as far as I know, because business should not be protected from putting people at risk.

Gather all the evidence of this as you can.

A few days after, my co-workers told me he threw a fit in his office and screamed that I was a whore and a trouble maker because a few people had gotten covid and called in sick.

Call the health department. Tell them you want to leave an anonymous tip that two workers are working after testing positive, under great pressure and against their better judgment.

Give them the employees names. Give them the manager's name. Ask them what will happen. Suggest that you might call local news if they do nothing.

Might be worth leaving a similar message with your corporate office and HR.

I live in a world renowned tourist destination that people travel from all around to world to for vacations.

It still happens but now they threaten anyone and everyone who might consider whisle blowing with termination and forcible removal from town. Both technically illegal but as with many tourist destinations these businesses are above the law and just bribe any authorities and officials to look the other way.

Don't go on vacation to common tourist destination guys. It doesn't matter how good the businesses in that area make themselves seem most of them are almost completely morally bankrupt.

I would lock up the room and put this sign instead:

""As too many staff members have been unable to clean up after themselves, it has been costing the company money for additional cleaning. As such, Management has decided to close the breakroom till further notice. Please consume your meals and snacks outside the building.""

I used to be friendly with facility managers and cleaners, they would get VERY pissed off at staff who don't clean up and I don't blame them.

SpiritualPlan5,hjy9c9p,"It’s hilarious they think they can dock your pay for dirty dishes in the kitchen. If they try call the department of labor. When I worked for the Olive Garden we made our own change for customers and then cashed out at the end of the night, so they always told us that if someone dined and dashed they would just come out of our pockets. They claimed it was because we were responsible for watching our section, but they wouldn’t allow us to watch our section because the food had to be run it had to be run no matter who is table it was going to. Which is a pretty good system, but you  physically can’t be on both sides of the restaurant at once.
Anyway, my point is that they said they would they even did it, until they did it to the wrong person and that person called the department of labor.

JayGeezey,hjy58ij,"Edit: I didn't catch that they charge EVERY EMPLOYEE $25 if only one person leaves a mess, somehow read that as ""this rule applies to everyone"" the first time around. I don't see how this could possibly be legal

To be clear, I'm not defending this behavior from the employer, but depending on how they actually approach it, it may or may not be illegal

If they take the $25 out of the employees paycheck it might be illegal, or if they tried to make your employment contingent on paying the fine (""if you don't pay then you're fired"") that might be illegal as well

But I'm honestly not sure, like if you quit a job and you're supposed to return a work uniform and don't, can't they legally take the cost of the uniform out of your last pay check? Again - super bull shit behavior, but if that's legal I could see how charging an employee the cost of cleaning would also be legal, the difference is that it's the cost of cleaning the property instead of replacing it (like the uniform example)

I bring all this up to caution on OP approaching a lawyer, as that could be very expensive just to be consulted that the employer is indeed in their legal right to do this

Either way... there's lots of jobs open these days, fuck working for an employer like this, I'd personally look for another job.

D_Tuba,hjyeft9,">I know some of you say, this is illegal, but what’s so fucking hard about cleaning after yourself?

That's not the point of this post though. It's about an employer (someone if authority and power) clearly overstepping their boundaries and doing something illegal. Or at least trying to.

She insisted on doing it however, even though many of the local women, who were employed there, told the husband to keep her away from money. The big blow up was when the wife shorted the till by a significant amount. The husband decides that it really wasn't her fault, it had to be everybody else working at time, and the loss was coming out of their checks.

He was told that was illegal, but decided to do it anyway. In the end he saw the error of his way after a ""meeting"" with some of the more wild local customers.

distantapplause,hjy7j6k,">if you quit a job and you're supposed to return a work uniform and don't, can't they legally take the cost of the uniform out of your last pay check?

They can only recover reasonable costs that roughly correspond to their own financial harm. So they could dock $30 for a uniform but if they tried to dock $300 then they would be on shakier ground.

In this instance, if there are 20 employees and they all get fined $25 because someone left a dirty bowl on the table, the employer would have to prove that they incurred costs somewhere near $500 as a result of that, which seems unlikely. If on the other hand there are only three employees and they make an absolute mess of the kitchen and the employer needs to bring the cleaner in for an extra shift, it's perhaps more reasonable.

IANAL and it probably depends on the jurisdiction, but I think this is generally how financial penalties usually work across the world. Generally only a court can levy penalties in excess of actual costs as a deterrent or punishment (i.e. punitive damages).",10,Found this in the break room in my new office.

But if the situation was what I thought it was originally, that if you left a mess in the break room you'd personally be charged $25, I don't see how that's very different from charging for a uniform that's not returned. Not returning a uniform charge = cost of replacing property the employee took, cleaning charge = cost of cleaning property the employee made dirty.

tapobu,hjyxywq,"So there's some precedent in a few tribes, but a lot of the blood percentage stuff is enacted by governments, not by tribes. If I remember correctly, Canada has made strong attempts to reduce the number of tribe members receiving aid by increasing the blood requirement. Maybe the USA did too, but I feel like it was Canada mostly. There are a few tribes who have been trying to expel members with incredibly low quantities of blood, like Elizabeth Warren levels of low, but it's not particularly controversial or surprising. 

The only real case of mass expulsions that comes to mind is the Cherokee expulsion of descendants of their slaves. In 1866 after the war ended, the Cherokee signed a treaty with America that basically stated their freed slaves were now tribe members, but in 2007 they attempted to expel anyone not related by blood, which was around 2,800 people. I judge later ruled that they weren't allowed to do that because of the treaty.

ARecipeForCake,hjxvf04,"They don't just lobby to allow themselves to pay welfare wages, they lobby to make welfare benefits require that you work a certain amount and make under a certain amount in order to qualify, ultimately excluding the most desperate and reserving the almost entire horde of welfare benefits to these predatory employers.

Desperate, homeless, starving and want food stamps? Well you might be surprised to find that unless you work 20 hours per week and make under a certain amount, basically unless you work for walmart, then you don't qualify unless you meet certain temporary-term qualifications like a recent lay off that may qualify you for temporary assistance.

Basically they lobby for slaves. There's no money or room for actual welfare anymore because it's all been compartmentalized into different levels and types of McPayCheck assistance. Its like this is horseshit. There should be no McPayCheck assistance, those are people with jobs that should have to pay living wages to their employees and our welfare system needs to be taken back for the people who are living in fucking tents in my city. Landing a steady job should be what gets you off of assistance, not what qualifies you for it. Just subsidizing poverty wages at multibillion dollar companies with the welfare fund that should be helping people who need help, not people with jobs at multibillion dollar companies. 

I think hourly pay before overtime hours should basically be illegal and perceived as part of malicious labor schemes by companies. The minimum wage should not be XYZ per hour, but XYZ per year for FT and a % of XYZ per year for PT. No more incentives to create fucked up schedules that just barely fuck an employee out of benefits. Designate employees now as either full time or part time, and set laws standardizing max utilization of a full time or part time employee before overtime rates are calculated(FT OT after 35 hrs, PT OT after 20 hrs) separate healthcare from employment entirely so people can actually go back to working part time while they pursue an education or take care of a chronically ill loved one, or have a freaking baby i dont know, im not a life coach i just know life sucks now and people used to have babies and shit without talking about it costing a whole ass down payment on a house.",1913,How the fu*k can billionaire corporations pay so little in wages that their employees get food stamps paid by tax ?,wolfnotapup92,/r/antiwork/comments/qq0zzm/how_the_fuk_can_billionaire_corporations_pay_so/hjxvf04/,0.09,0.12,0.791,-0.9611

Stewart Walton has a massive collection of World War 2 fighter planes at the municipal airport here and has staff that restore and maintain them so he can joy ride.

The electrical design for their campus requires an entire new transmission circuit for the city. I'm not talking about the power lines that go to the transformer for your house but the high voltage transmission that your power company transforms down at a substation. This is a $59 million project alone.

There is also an area of town north of the new campus site that has overhead power lines. Alice Walton a while back visited and didn't like the look of the overhead lines so they're taking that ALL underground as part of the campus project. That alone is $22 million.

That meme with Fry about how one day he'll be rich? Yeah, its total bullshit and the reality is much, much, worse.

They aren't stupid. They know they'll never be rich. And they're fine with that. They genuinely, truly, honestly, believe that rich people are better than they are. They believe that rich people should not be required to follow the same rules they are. They believe that rich people deserve better treatment by police and judges. 

That's why they were fine with Trump being a tax dodging rapist. People on the more liberal end thought that would be a slam dunk against him, but it isn't because the right believes he \*\*DESERVES\*\* not to dodge taxes and to rape children because he's above them on the hierarchy.

The average right winger is totally fine with not being at the top of the heap... as long as they aren't at the very bottom. As long as there's someone, anyone, lower on the social hierarchy than they are, someone they can kick around and feel superior to, they're totally content with the rich being above them. They see it as the natural order of the universe.

Philanthropy is just a way to privatize societal failings. I’m all for local folks helping their own community. But the way billionaires do it; it’s at a level that makes up for lack of government safety nets. Some billionaires do conservation efforts, which again should fall on the government to protect public lands (including rainforests). Some billionaires do food drives and clothing drives; which again should fall on the government to keep its people clothed/fed. Instead of having your taxes go towards helping your fellow citizen not go cold/hungry they just go towards corporate welfare and now we’re at a point where we’re at the mercy of billionaires to help the working class. 

In other words: if they actually paid their taxes then we wouldn’t need their charity.

fdc7719,hjyexr7,"Here’s how I’ve seen this play out. People making $15-20/hour for semi-skilled to skilled labor hear about the minimum wage potentially getting moved to $15/hour and flip out because their skills are perceived to be devalued. The reality is that the people already making $15-20/hour are also very likely underpaid, but if you’re making 2-3x what minimum wage is, employers can boast that you are making 2-3x and should be happy about it. I make over the equivalent of $30/hour and my wife makes more. We’ve also been poor. Extremely poor. Paying taxes into social programs doesn’t bother us at all. We also donate to causes we care about. We live within our means and can have enough left over to put some away and help people we know out if something comes up with them. 

The issue that’s made up is immigrants, legal or illegal coming in and taking away jobs, or simply that anyone that appears to do less than you do for your pittance stirs anger about your own struggles or how hard you work to still be underpaid. There’s a whole right-wing propaganda machine that keeps us all fighting for scraps and to protect their owners. 

If this were an earlier point in history there’s a fair chance that people would rise up, but they have just barely enough to survive on so they don’t. True hunger will be what I expect to be what drives the next large movement against the upper class - provided people haven’t been manipulated enough to continue to fight for scraps when more people are starving. This will only get worse as resources are strained because of climate change. 

Hoarding wealth and power has historically rarely ever worked out well for the hoarders or their slaves/wage slaves. These people believe that they’ll just live out their days in their extravagant bunkers while the world burns, but honestly, if they don’t have the wealth to flaunt, the attention it brings or the freedoms to do whatever you want, whenever you want and wherever you want being reduced to hiding in a bunker won’t last long. They’ll likely want to become warlords or establish old-school kingdoms so they can rule. 

I really hope I’m wrong, but look at the systematic removal of rights to organize labor, the complete lack of accountability for the wealthy already and how violent the rhetoric is getting.

GabrielStarwood,hjyive2,"RE: Witches, but on topic, I swear

Throughout history, the wealthy have done a fantastic job of turning the poor on each other to keep them distracted from who is actually to blame, all while spending a small portion of taxes on something they claim is a solution but is really just meant to divide the poor by design.  

An interesting example I had never read about until recently was the rise of the ""witch"" phenomenon.  I had always thought that it was rooted in religious zelotry, and while thats something that is being leveraged against the poor in this instance, the actual concept of ""the witch"" was designed entirely by the wealthy authority to quell smaller populations on the verge of uprising. They knew it was total bullshit, but it was too brilliant to pass up. Bad harvest and everyone's starving but the taxes are still due?  The duke is sending his witch finder to the village to investigate, and THAT costs money, so if you want to find the witch that caused the bad harvest, you have to pay your taxes.  You want to find the witch, dont you?  Ofcourse you do!  There there she is over there!  And bang, two for one brilliant dupe.  They not only found a compkerely innocent person to blame for the problems their greed directly caused the poor people they were exhtorting, but they also used it to justyfy their tax collection in times of crisis. 

EDIT: Its also worth noting, the interpersonal turmoil caused by the concept of ""the witch"" also kept the starving villagers fighting eachother everytime a misfortune befell the community, so with its ability to keep them from uprising by keeping them weak and divided, the control effects lasted generations. Even generations after the last witch was discovered, it was an extremely effective means of turning the people against a trouble cause rabble rouser.  Got a rebellion brewing?  Send in the witch finder who no doubt will discover that any seditious citizens are actually speaking such lies of their liege because theyre witches or warlocks, and bam!

I_madeusay_underwear,hjxlryf,"American culture is weird. We’ll fight someone over a cheap TV but we let the rich and the powerful fuck us for our whole lives. 

Partly I think it’s because it’s been gradual to get to where we are. My parents’ generation didn’t face the same adversity and wealth disparity that I do. When you grow up and see your parents work a job and provide for a family it doesn’t immediately click why you can’t do the same.

Some of it is external too. American culture tells us that we can be and do anything if we just work hard enough and it sounds inspiring but really it shifts the onus onto each individual while alleviating the corrupt systems we live in from all guilt. Work ethic is seen as a virtue and we’re raised to believe that poverty is a moral failing of the individual so there’s little solidarity. 

Americans will fight. We’ll fight against things and for things and because we’re good at it. We’ll fight other people’s battles even though they ask us not to.

yingyangyoung,hjyl7ot,"That's an even bigger issue currently. The stock market is so overvalued right now it's ridiculous. Tesla's price to earnings ratio is currently 341 years. One way to interpret this is that under current earnings it will take 341 years to pay back investors for the purchase of the stock, but really it's a measure of market cap to profits. 

PE is generally greater than 1 because investors anticipate future growth/returns, but a PE that high is a strong indicator that that particular stock is oversold, ie priced higher than it realistically should be. 

Now, elon musk has a ""net worth"" of $275 billion is primarily made up of his 23% share of tesla, which like I said is overvalued. Sure the company does have assets, but it's nowhere near what the stock price is valued at. According to Wikipedia the current assets are 52.2 billion and the total equity (which factors in debts and other liabilities) is only 22.2 billion, and last year it only saw a net income of 721 million. Even though the company has an evaluation (market cap) of just over 1 trillion, it only really has a true value if liquidated of 22.2 billion. This is why people say they only have billions because we let them.

sotonohito,hjyvjvj,"Because the Democrats aren't a left wing party. They are to the left of the Republicans, but in their case that means they're center right while the Republicans are far right.

There is no actual left wing party in the USA.

In practical terms that means that the Democrats are still firm believers in hierarchy, they just want to have a kinder, gentler, hierarchy. They want the billionaires to be nice. They want the people at the bottom of the heap not to be quite so oppressed and downtrodden.

But at heat they still think there should be billionaires and poor people. At core they still think a social hierarchy is some combination of good, valid, necessary, or inevitable.

A left wing person wants to get rid of the hierarchy, not attempt to mitigate the worst of the harm it does.

space_moron,hjycsqb,"There's lots of quiet, subtle ways you'll get fucked over in the United States that aren't always obvious, so people will walk on eggshells they can't even see for fear of unknown repercussions.

Your credit score is one big example. You do not consent to getting a credit score and you cannot opt out of it. Behaving well and paying your debts quickly might harm your credit score! So you have to play the game and get the right amount of debt to get a good score. But too much debt and you're hurt again! If your score is bad, you won't be able to rent an apartment. You might not be hired for certain jobs. You won't be able to purchase a home or lease a vehicle. Yet even trying to observe your score can be taken against you! You need to quietly play the game and don't make any sudden movements or you'll hurt The Score.

Arrest and driving records are another.  Criminal background checks can prevent you from getting a job, renting a home, qualifying for a loan. Say you peacefully protest for Medicare for all but there's a scuffle and the police arrest you because you happened to be standing near it. Who is the judge going to believe? Now there's a mark on your record, possibly for life. Even if you've served your sentence, you might always have that mark and always be denied jobs, and possibly not even be able to vote and advocate for yourself again.

If you've been evicted, now you've got an eviction record. Maybe you fully clean up your situation (assuming you got into a bad one to begin with...) and are ready to rent and be independent again. Potential landlords will all see that eviction record and all flag you as a bad tenant not to be rented to.

Just started a new job to get a better wage? Congrats! But maybe you have to wait 3-6 months before your health insurance kicks in. So you really want to risk attending a march or protest where you might sprain an ankle or get heat stroke? Better to stay home and move softly so as not to injure yourself when you can't afford it (and to be honest, you probably can't afford it with insurance, either).

Someone takes a photo of you at a protest or retweets your antiwork meme, your boss might see it and decide you're not a team player. How are you going to explain that gap in your resume? The longer the gap goes on, the harder it is to find work.

Lots of little invisible fences surrounding everyone and narrowing their behavior and thought. Lots of caution you need to take in your day to day life since one-time mistakes can lead to lifelong devastating consequences.

If you're upset about the state of things it's safer to just go to the bar and get drunk or stay home playing video games like everyone else.",13,How the fu*k can billionaire corporations pay so little in wages that their employees get food stamps paid by tax ?,wolfnotapup92,/r/antiwork/comments/qq0zzm/how_the_fuk_can_billionaire_corporations_pay_so/hjycsqb/,0.1,0.146,0.753,-0.988

-----Nice-----,hjxwinr,"Lol yup bringing this up is another thing that triggers them. I also like to bring up the fact that Republicans are more likely to be less educated and the more education someone has, the more left leaning they tend to be. I wouldn’t call myself a Democrat since I have my issues with that party too, but I’m also not going to ignore facts. 

I’ve noticed a lot of Republicans will refute shit like that with “you’re an idiot if you believe that” or “that’s just the liberal media lying to you”.

The party that likes to call people snowflakes and say things like “fuck your feelings” sure does love pretending like what they feel means more than actual proven facts or data.

So when people  hear about wealth inequality and demands for better treatment of employees, they kind of roll their eyes and tsk-tsk. Since, of course, midwesterners are the only REAL Americans and it’s their work ethic and perseverance alone that’s helped isolate them from the growing gaps between income and cost of living. It really helps reinforce the idea that anyone can work themselves out of poverty or misery because that’s been their experience and that’s the only valid experience there is.

He hasn't fulfilled his campaign promises on medicare expansion, letting Medicare negotiate drug prices, the public option, free community college, cancelling $10,000 of student debt, decriminalizing marijuana, and many other important issues.

He has fulfilled his promise not to fundamentally change anything. Which is why we hate Biden because this country is miserable to live in.

>but I also know that he and other Democratic nominees stood on the debate stage in 2020 and said ""Single payer healthcare will bankrupt America!"", despite knowing full well that single payer costs half of what we pay now and would save tens of thousands of lives annually.

These were always bad faith smears. No one was worried about $7 trillion spent every 10 years for the MIC bankrupting the country, shame on every Democrat (Mayor Pete, Biden, Klob) who used these nonsense arguments.

>Also, you need to understand the privilege that people like Manchin and Sinema afford other corporate Democrats: as long as they know that Manchin and his ilk will never let promised legislation pass, the rest can pocket the same corporate money but grandstand and say ""Oh, I support everything you want! $15 min wage and unions and everything, but oh, man, I worked real hard but we just can't get it done. But keep donating to me and voting for me.""

TurgidTermite,hjy724k,"European business is still successful and has been eating up US market share for decades even though they have much higher labor costs and had their industry decimated after WWII. They had to rebuild from scratch and yet still gained ground.

They do it by producing superior products through R&D which is high risk, high reward, and also by investing in long term productivity gains via technology.

If you can't get a slave, you instead have to pull on different levers to be successful. European managers have to be more creative and take more risks.

American business-owners are used to squeezing labor or offshoring jobs rather than doing anything creative. It works but it's lazy and has long term costs which we're suffering from now.

Like the Roman Empire, instead of investing in tech, we rely on cheap human labor. It ended with rule by out-of-touch aristocrats that caused their empire to collapse.

Wealth inequality today is about as bad as it was during the late Roman Empire. We also have a disposable class of laborer and rely too heavily on them, like Romans relied on slaves. We also have a caste system though it is in the shadows. We also are ruled by greedy oligarchs that believe they have a divine right to rule over others, and have no sense of economic sustainability.

As a Dutchman, I get universal health care, excellent roads, good public transport, and easily accessible high quality education.

As an American, you get to dream that you too will be rich some day.

nivenkos,hjxtirb,"The reality is: As a Dutchman, struggle for over a decade to save for a 600k mortgage to afford a 50m2 flat, on a 50k salary. Get stuck renting and paying more than you would in mortgage repayments, plus the cost and hassle of moving every 2 years. All the while paying huge amounts of income tax so you can't build up your own savings.

The European model of high income and consumption taxes, low corporation and capital gains taxes and almost non-existent property and inheritance taxes works well for those who already have family wealth / property. But for those who need to build up wealth, it is a trap.

A true social democratic state should aim to abolish income tax for all but the highest earners, and abolish sales tax. Instead recouping the tax via property tax, inheritance tax, capital gains tax and other wealth taxes.

Americans always think the grass is greener, but in reality it's often because they move to Europe as retirees (or established professionals, or as contractors for US companies) and so have already built up their wealth and then benefit from not paying property tax or income tax.",54,"Come for the promise of freedom, liberty, and money.

You make around 25k right now for an entry level job at full time where I live. Most wages are $12-13 /hr. It's not enough to live off of unless you are really living a budget and paycheck to paycheck life.

But as you gain more work experience, you find better jobs and you get better wages. You move from 25k a year when you're 18-21 to 32k at ages 22-26. Around 27-32, you're probably getting around 40k and benefits are getting better.

EngProfOkstate,hjywbe7,"Our tax system is exactly this. The marginal tax rate on 70K-130K on income is like 24+% federal, 10% payroll, 5-10% state, 8-10% sales taxes on your spending money, your house taxes may be another 5% of your income, and then, you might be SALT capped on your deductions, child tax credits disappear, those stimulus payments are phased out, etc (out of 7K in payments I would have been eligible if I made 20K less, we got like 600$).  I've been in this income range for a decade now and have been able to save very little because a full 40-50% of my income goes to taxes (I track it carefully). Oddly, my tax rates go down as my income goes up from here because SS taxes drop off, all the phase outs already happened, but still it is high as long as it is wage income. The tax system makes it impossible to accumulate enough wealth within any lifespan to break into the 'ownership class'. You make enough to eat, and house yourself, which is great, but you can't keep enough money to actually build wealth, especially outside of a home or retirement plans (which get taxed at full wage tax rates later in life anyways).

But, if you are in the ownership class (business owner, just have wealth, property mogul etc.) and make let's say a million dollars on your wealth of tens of millions of dollars, your tax rate on income is like 15-20% because it can be done as capital gains and dividends, payroll taxes are like 3% for medicare maybe, you get a host of deductions that you can claim through your business, it's so easy to lie about your income too -- the IRS won't monitor your business vehicle movements for example to see how much is business use vs person use and cash payments you take can easily be unrecorded etc, you can deduct the entire 'value' of appreciated property used for donations against your income you pay taxes on even though you never paid taxes on said appreciation to begin with (double dip charitable deductions!), a lot of states will exclude capital gains taxes on in-state businesses, etc. So, your effective tax rates, all encompassing, is like half the amount as the worker making a tenth as much. Heck, for some, you can get it to less than 10% without too much effort if you really lean into the deductions. That lower tax rate means you have all that much more income you can reinvest, build your wealth, and get richer and richer and richer over your life.

Anyways, our tax system doesn't allow a WORKER to keep enough money to build wealth. Meanwhile, the ownership class pays so little taxes its hard not to build wealth.

Just to give you an idea: here is the number of nurses and doctors per capita in OECD countries: [https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/data-insights/number-of-medical-doctors-and-nurses](https://www.oecd.org/coronavirus/en/data-insights/number-of-medical-doctors-and-nurses)

In NL, you can live in rural area without even owning a car - the train network is pretty well developed and employers reimburse the costs of tickets. To move around a city, people either use public transport or bikes, which are often faster than cars. 150$ seems so much compared to what I used to pay for transport (which is nothing, except for occasional city breaks).

Dude years ago I was looking on craigslist at freelance dev gigs.  Saw something exactly this.

I contacted him for more details.  1. You had to sign a contract agreeing to do the work before you even know what the idea is. 2. He owns EVERYTHING. 3. You will be ""fairly compensated"" (if) it takes off and essentially makes him rich.

I just messaged him to ask about the cost of development outside just the hours spent working on it.  i.e. if its a webapp.  You will need hosting and adequate bandwidth to support a user base and this costs money, will you be paying for that or do you expect the developer to pay for that?  He said he expects the developer to pay for that as that's part of the development work.

I was like dude.   You are asking them to commit their time and resources to a project, which they don't even know what it is, for a vague promise of ""fair compensation"" which is subject to your personal opinion as to whats fair, that is dependent on the feasibility of an idea they aren't allowed to know before signing a contract agreeing to all of this.

Mister_Shelbers,hjyq6ho,"My friend worked as a busser at a busy restaurant a while back. He was told that he could serve after a couple weeks bussing but they never let him because he kicked so much ass bussing, making practically nothing. He always stayed late and picked up open shifts and always came in when they needed him (which was often). He also did loads of extra work helping everyone else out (I’ve worked with him before, he’s awesome like that). The girls would always flirt with him and want to know his schedule because they knew if they had a busy night and he wasn’t there they’d be fucked (understandably considering the pay none of the other bussers were worth a damn). Anyway there was this creep of a manager who worked nights and probably would have been fired for harassing the girls if he hadn’t been a manager. Apparently he didn’t like my buddy getting flirted with etc. and started giving him shit every time they worked together.  Eventually he started getting on to him for being late, which was technically true but there were never any tables to bus for like the first half hour anyway. My friend just walked out and never came back. This might not sound like much but this guy has never quit a job without notice in his life, much less walked out in the middle of a busy shift.

Big-Quality3817,hjyv1sg,"Worked at an Applebees briefly about 25 years ago.  I was SHOCKED seeing the (side) work they put on the $2.13/hour  service staff including taking the garbage out back to the dumpster.....typically the hourly dishwasher's job.  Also ""heavy"" cleaning and borderline 'maintenance' that would usually performed by an hourly employees.

Seriously exploitative going WAY back. I always wondered how the customers would feel knowing they were being served by a person wearing a shirt that was hugging an overfilled garbage can to dump it a few minutes before.

Also, the ""happy hours"" where they eked out a few more dollars of revenue  selling half-price appetizers and I think a cheap daily drink special late into the evening was exploitative and basically enabled by being able to abuse cheap labor....especially after a 3% tip out to pay the busboys, yet even another scam.  Suffice it to say that people motivated to come in by $3 cheese sticks rarely find themselves motivated to compensate the server at a worthwhile level.

While I'm on a rant incidentally, the management in these places tended to be DUMB and CLUELESS.     Once during an employee meeting complaints were raised about crap tips on day shifts.  One employee was held up as an example as she was ""banking"" on days.   I commented ""Yea...she spends the shift basically ***blowing*** (flirting, entertaining, kissing ass) her tables while exploiting the communal system (letting everyone else do the work)  that does everything except punch an order into the computer.""

At a similar chain a female African American bartender got lauded in a meeting (implicit scolding for everyone else for not being a ""super performer"") for being REALLY great at selling premium liquor Hennessey.   Me:  ""Ummm black guys come up to the bar to hit on her.

The_Quicktrigger,hjz58d1,"There are tools that can help.  If a leader comes from the group he is leading, it tends to make them a better leader.  You aren't as likely to trip on power if you can relate to those you'd be tripping on.  To add to that a good leader needs to be willing to return to his roots to keep that humbling mindset intact.  The longer somebody goes without that direct relation, the easier it becomes to disconnect from them.  I knew managers who were great people because they took calls in the call center just like everybody else, not because they had to but because they had to keep it fresh in their mind.

Another which is slightly less out of ones control is the abuse of the previous leadership.  Good managers tend to be born from the ashes of a bad manager.  Once you've personally experienced what an abuse of power can do to you, you are far more likely to tread carefully once you are in power yourself.  Best manager I ever worked under told us that he had a shitty manager when he started and he promised himself he would never end up like that.

I mean outside of that you have the mechanics of leadership which GCP grey outlined pretty well in this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rStL7niR7gs

Black_Sky_Thinking,hjxku1h,"I actually think it’s a problem with the Americanised way of customer service. Non-Americans don’t tend to know this, but the US is a bit of an outlier with the “customer is always right” approach, with all the cheesy smiles and fake-hyper-happiness.

In most of the rest of the world, the customers are generally beholden to the staff. From Eastern Europe to Asia, the Middle East etc, customers are expected to behave themselves because the staff have something they want.
Hell, France is notorious for the exclusivity and defiant attitude of its staff. Throw a tantrum in a shop in Paris, Moscow or Shanghai and you’ll be physically thrown out.

Used to be the same in the UK too (my parents talk about it) until we drifted towards a more Americanised culture.

Now, I’m not advocating for bad behaviour from staff. But I think we’ve grown an expectation that staff will put up with literally anything whilst wearing a fixed smile, so shitty people started using them as an emotional punching bag.

I don’t really know what the solution is, other than to get tough and start banning and ejecting people.

mep16122112,hjxo2rv,"I work at an outdoor specialty store that's somewhat lovely owned (five stores all in one state). We have gotten restraining orders on some people, but only repeat offenders. Which sucks because it means that every customer has the chance to yell at us once and still ""needs to be treated like a customer"" instead of an asshole. 

I had one lady come in and ask me the difference between 3 hiking shoes. I told her that two are waterproof and one is ventilated. She wasn't satisfied. ""What's the difference between the waterproof ones?"" Her tone was frustrated to begin with but not it was bordering on yelling. I flipped the shoes upside-down showing her the tread on the bottom and began to tell her that one tread pattern and rubber combination is better for wet, rocky terrain, while another was good for dusty, dry, loose dirt and rock. She begins to raise her voice more saying ""you obviously don't know your stock so get someone who does!"" Before i can walk away to get someone else, she asks me what the name of a particular shoe is. It was a pretty new shoe to our store so i told her I needed to go to the back to check on the name. Came back, told her the name, and SHE ASKED AGAIN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE THREE SHOES. I, like a fool began to tell her the same info i had before to which she yelled ""well i can just go shop somewhere else if you're just gonna know nothing about your stock!"" I started walking off and yelled back ""fine by me!""

I look at our backlog to see if her delivery is late or if it is making its way to her. See oders that were supposed to be done at 19.00 still in there so i ask around if someone knows. Her delivery was on its way and she was informed before hand it be arriving later than expected. I apologise to her for the inconvience and explain that we value her alot but also our drivers safety (4 of our drivers already had a near accident that evening). This lady is having none of it.

One job I had there was a customer that would flood our ticket system every day with 500+ automated, spam tickets because he was unhappy with some thing that wasn't possible with our service.  Block him from the service?  No no, he pays $30 a month.  

So lets have some of the staff that make $20 an hour spend half their shift or more cleaning out these tickets manually instead of helping actual customers.  This is on-going and is probably still happening 8+ months later.  Great use of resources, kind of respect the hustle though, whether he knew it or not he had been costing the company like $160 a day for 8+ months or so in labour.

Same applies for insanely abusive customers, how your company responds to these customers will absolutely effect an employee's choice about staying or leaving.

snythesnizer,hjy7l2v,"up until recently i worked at a vegan cafe that also serves food. lots of the food there is really solid, good quality vegan food, lots of fancy and hard to source vegan meats, cheeses, decent veggies, fresh bread, etc. i’m also vegan and i really appreciate the variety we have.


however there is also an extremely basic hummus sandwich on the menu which is just hummus and vegetables on bread. we had a regular customer who ordered this basic hummus sandwich every single day and would ask for the bread extra toasted. somehow she would always, always find an issue with the sandwich and call to complain in a very nasty way and demand a refund. sometimes there wasn’t enough or there was too much hummus, one time she decided there wasn’t enough avocado, one time not enough salt on the tomatoes. usually though it was an issue of the bread not being toasted enough. and of course we know her order and are toasting the bread extra every single time.


anyway the last time she calls she actually starts yelling like usual that there’s always an issue with us and she demands a refund for her hummus sandwich. we tell her no because we were extremely careful just as we ALWAYS are to make her sandwich correctly, she can’t keep harassing us and asking for refunds, and frankly she needs to make her own sandwiches if she’s going to be so particular about a HUMMUS SANDWICH. she starts absolutely losing it and cursing us out, we tell her that she doesn’t get to speak to us with this disrespect and in fact she’s banned from the store from now on. all over some hummus! it feels good.


also i banned a guy once who came up to order with no mask on and when i told him he needed to put on a mask he said “i identify as wearing a mask”. tbh i saw red, just started telling him to get the f*ck out and he wasn’t going to order from us with that kind of attitude and good luck getting coffee from somewhere else. he tried to argue that he was entitled to order from us(? no you’re not babe it doesn’t work like that) but i just sort of loudly talked over him to leave until he left. he wasn’t ready for that kind of pushback but i’m just not entertaining these people with these attitudes anymore.",1,Why isn't banning customers from a store a thing?,Mean-Entrepreneur298,/r/antiwork/comments/qq28cw/why_isnt_banning_customers_from_a_store_a_thing/hjy7l2v/,0.052,0.064,0.883,-0.4837

Sargonnax,hjy7p2q,"There are some legal aspects to actual banning that get in the way. A lawyer at a company I worked for in the past said if I actually told a person he or she was banned, and that person tried to fight it legally, we would usually lose. 

You can always ask someone to leave, but whether they do or not without the police or security involved is the issue.

What you can do is call the police, sign a complaint against the person with the police, and they will tell the person he/she is not welcome and will be charged with trespassing if the person returns to the property. Usually this scares off most people when it's simple stuff

The police get upset when they are called to a business, but the reps for the business wont sign off on some type of complaint, which means the police often cant do much and the offender goes to the next business down the street to be an asshole again. 

The only thing that stops the worst people is having to face consequences for their actions and behaviors.

caboose2006,hjy7vgb,"Lemme tell you about Mark. I worked at a brand new high end wine bar and seafood joint. We were affiliated but not owned by a big international hotel chain. So we could do room charges. The ceiling for Bullshit was already set high at training. Anyway, after we had been open about a year along came Mark.

Now Mark had a reputation. He had been 86'd from several places around town already. He did something in real estate. When he was by himself he wasn't completely insufferable, but when he had a client, oh boy. Dude's demand was over the top. He didn't want the boiling hot water that came out of the faucet of our tea station. He wanted the cooks to put the water in a pan and boil it. He didn't want what was on this months specials menu, he wanted something off the specials menu from three months ago. He didn't want to sit in the cocktail lounge, he wanted us to make the patio, which would be closed for the season (all chairs and tables in storage) made ready and hospitable for him and his client in the dead if winter (we would have to beg borrow and steal heaters). He knows damn well that the patio is closed. And it wasn't just his demands, it was how he asked and how he belittled you in front of his almost equally douchey clients.

Now, serving Mark sucked on the best of days. But what made it worse was the constant thought of ""Am I gonna get paid for all of this work?"" Because Mark walked out on his bills CONSTANTLY. 1/3 OF THE TIME. No exaggeration.

The restaurant. Didn't care. They had one of his credit cards on file. The restaurant got paid. The servers lost money because no tip and we still had to tip out the hosts, bar, bussers and food runnners. They didn't start doing anything until his credit cards got declined. Even then, gave him second, third, fourth, fifth chances. Because ""86ing a customer can really hurt your reputation.""

madamxombie,hjy7ynb,"I get “why.” That person you ban is no longer spending money at your establishment, and they may encourage others to not spend money at your establishment. 

Owners absolutely prefer their money over their employees. 

Luckily, by the time I got to be a retail manager, the company I was working for was being pretty negligent about everything because they were going bankrupt. Abusing the employees under me was absolutely not acceptable, by anyone. 

One time, I came out of the back room to hear a customer finish yelling “-you stupid bitch!” at one of my employees. This employee was one of the sweetest girls I have ever met, so I immediately got PISSED. Came over and said “hi, I’m the manager here. You need to get out of this store immediately. Goodbye.” while pointing at the entrance. She asked me if I wanted to bother to know what my “bitch if an employee did” to her. “Nope, no I don’t. Bye. Don’t come back.” She went NUTS. Throwing tea pots at other customers, attempting to climb the bar counter. I ran my fat ass around the counter and used my body to physically walk her back out of the store as my employee was phoning security (mall). You know what that commotion did? DREW PEOPLE OVER TO THE STORE. I made a few trays of samples after cleaning up the glass and handed them out to the spectators and offered 5% off our take home products. Record sales that day. 

I ended up asking my employee why that lady was so pissed. She wanted a sample of someone’s drink. Like; their prepared drink they paid for.

Kindly_Log9771,hjy90vv,"I worked at a dispensary in a legal state. We would get the shittiest and rudest people. They’re in the right always because “they just need their medicine” or “I haven’t smoked all day and I need to relax” every single time they would talk down to me like I wasn’t the one literally grabbing what they want and weigh it up to how much they want. One time this guy threatened to fight me because we had a rule of only a 1/4oz-1/2oz for a specific strain. They didn’t like that and started calling me every name in the book. My manager came out and said “hey just go to the back and someone else can finish this transaction”. When I go to the back office he tells me to basically agree with the customers cause they’re the ones that are right and if I deal with it, the faster they get out. 

Fast forward to another customer who takes my head off because I wouldn’t weigh out 8-1/8ths for a full oz on the busiest day of the week. He yells at me, telling me I’m wrong and don’t know how to do my job, I said it’s busy right now, if you want to wait until it’s not busy I can do that for you. He continues on some I don’t have time, I have to get home and start cooking after a long day at work. Oh I’m sorry, I haven’t eaten all day during my 10 hour shift. Finally he leaves after I told him, he nice or I just won’t weigh up your stuff. My manager over hears that and says “treat everyone with respect, you have no idea what they’re going through”. Dude just demeaned me to a nobody, someone threatened me and another guy told me I’m literally nothing. 

Finally the second customer comes back in and gets helped by a woman. He demeans her until she says fine I’ll weigh you 8-1/8ths. Once he leaves I tell them the story of the interaction. “Oh yeah, that sounds like your fault, you never know what people are going though.” And “you have to make sure you’re nice to everyone cause we want them to come back”.

Both people were on the “banned” list. Came in “apologized” TO THE MANAGER, never the actual person they were fucked up to and let in again to be served by the same person that they’re going to talk to the same way. I even had a guy ask me “oh so you thought you could ban me? Get me my weed” 

I think that’s gaslighiting? Idk but the manager tried to fight me when I said you’re victim blaming me. He had some personal issues because I was saying they were victim blaming me and he thinks it’s only for d.v. Cases? Idk but I left that same night and never went back.

Several days prior they were not open because nobody came in to work etc. So while I’m there shopping for some wine yet stuff, s female customer and her daughter become very hostile to the store staff. There were some women’s shirts on sale, but one get one free. Limited stock, limited colors. So the woman proceeded to berate the staff that the color she wanted was not available. They told her it’s a popular sale and she could try another location (far away since this company shared limited physical stores). The young sales girl was visibly shaken.

The rude customers take up tons of time, run scams, want free shit all the time, etc. It's basically their goal *not* to be worth keeping as customers.

SamuraiJakkass86,hjylcx4,"1. You need some way to identify the customer accurately and exclusively in order to ban them.  That means you'll have to get their drivers license or similar identifying information in order to do this.  Anything less effort than this is going to potentially result in mistaken identity/racial profiling, or something similar that can get your store sued.
2. In order to verify that you are not allowing banned people in, you need to then start checking everyones ID's before they come in.
3. This also assumes that the person in question doesn't just obtain a fake ID to spoof the ban.
4. All of this also assumes that you have qualified professionals that are able to perform the security checks.
5. It also assumes that the people who are not banned are okay with having their ID checked everytime they go to your store.  Even if you are not banned, it sucks being carded everytime you enter a store where there isn't a required age limit.
6. The previously mentioned personnel must also be compensated accordingly for doing this kind of work.  So your store is losing money if they have to hire someone like this - especially if they are paying a living wage.  Imagine the anger when your other employees found out you're paying a security guard more money than they're paying the rest of you?  lol.

Important to remember though; customers that would be shit enough to get themselves banned are not likely the type to ever return in the first place.  There will always be turds that won't flush of course, but the vast majority of angry spaz-karens are going to never return and all of the precautions and proactive solutions you put in place to ensure that are significant expenditures to handle the small fraction of a % that do try to evade the ban.",1,Why isn't banning customers from a store a thing?,Mean-Entrepreneur298,/r/antiwork/comments/qq28cw/why_isnt_banning_customers_from_a_store_a_thing/hjylcx4/,0.076,0.081,0.843,-0.6866

There were known shoplifters who would pick stuff up off the shelf, and walk to the counter for a refund, stealing $1000’s this way.

Nickzreg,hjyopbt,"My first job was as a cashier at a supermarket. Since every person needs food they need to go foodshopping, so I saw people from all walks of life.

And nothing killed my perception of humanity being inherently good more than having to deal with the general public.

I'd say a good 60-75% of customers were just straight up rude. Most of these rude customers went out of their way to be rude. And they would throw temper tantrums over the dumbest things, or argue with the scanner about prices.

I realize now how fucked up it was that adults were hurling abuse at a 16-year-old. I was just a kid trying to make some money after school. Some of these rude customers were even the parents of my classmates!

And of course if they complained to management or customer service the store would always take their side and comp them. I can't tell you how many times these customers threatened to take their business elsewhere, but then came back week after week to hurl abuse at the staff. I'm assuming it's because management's freebies incentivized them to return.

I was miserable then but knew I'd be out in 2 years to go to college. So I can't imagine how miserable it is for people who make careers in retail or the service industry. If you have no other career options you just have to take this abuse while no one has your back.

Nickelback-Official,hjyox8w,"I used to work at a discount store in Toronto and while I could complain about certain aspects of the job, this specific issue was handled better than I initially expected.

One time I was stocking shredded cheese on the last day of the sale. 
 A customer starts going through the boxes on my cart, as soon as I noticed I stepped aside to allow him to choose from the shelf and I offered assistance. Once he finished looking and realized his choice of shredded cheese was out, he started yelling at me about the usual (bad management, misleading ads, awful customer service. The classic shitface 101). 

I had a long day, ad flips always come with more work, displays to change, upset customers etc., so I really was not in for it, I offered the guy a raincheck and was ready to move on, when he continues to raise his voice, point fingers and says the f*ed up things a shitty customer would say. 
As I'm telling him he can come back the next day and buy the cheese for 10% less(raincheck), my manager walks by. 
He stops to listen to the guy, then to my biggest surprise he told the customer to get out of the store or police will be involved. Customer tries to fight back, situation escalates to a screaming match. Customer eventually leaves, mumbling about corporate as he proceeds to the exit.

Next day I go in for my next shift, a photo of customer is on the 'wall of shame' next to aggressors and thieves, he'd been banned from the store. 

Others might have different experiences in retail, but I'm happy to say, our location always put extra effort into protecting their workers from abuse.

Anyway, this one guy at the party got drunk and started being REALLY inappropriate with the server. Asking her to come home with him, sit on his face etc. Another person at the party was trying to get him to stop (""c'mon man, she's your daughters age..."") Eventually he started following her around the restaurant. She had to put a tray in front of her to block him, went into the main part of the restaurant and ducked behind the bar. He followed. The supervisor was in the store room at the time.
 
The rest of the staff helped get this guy out and give him the number for a cab. Someone took over for the server who needed some time to get over having been assaulted in the workplace. The supervisor came back, asked where she was, I told him the story and he *went outside to apologize to the man, invited him back in, gave him a free drink, and went to get the server back on the floor.*

Jsf8957,hjyd2wv,"I work as a cashier at a small local grocery chain. A few months ago I overheard a customer yelling at one of our baggers who was struggling with emptying the bottle returns since she had hundreds of cans and was apparently in a hurry (more likely she’s just a b**ch). It’s also worth mentioning that during COVID my state has mandated a $25 per person per day limit on returns (to allow baggers more time to clean/sanitize). This particular bagger is developmentally disabled, too. Totally capable at doing his job, but seeing him get screamed at made me more upset than a typical obnoxious customer would. I paged the manager to handle the situation thinking he would calm the customer down and maybe even help the bagger out. She continues being rude and yelling at the manager. I would have kicked her out already... but if he wants to take her abuse that’s his choice. But then the lady said, and I quote, “I ought’a hit you!” ..directed at the bagger. Absolutely the last straw... right? Nope. My manager didn’t even acknowledge her threat of physical violence against his (again, developmentally disabled) employee, proceeded to let her exceed the $25 limit by over $50 dollars, and apologized profusely the whole time. I was gobsmacked.

I put in for a transfer to a different location and before I switched stores/managers I made sure every other cashier and bagger knew the full story and that the manager would not stand up for their safety or their dignity.

Not sure if anything came of it, but I’m glad I at least left that environment.

I dont speak amazing Spanish and if I was tired from trying to clearly communicate all day I'd eat at the Costco because everyone working there spoke English and it was a nice break. I never had a problem with their style of customer service but every so often I'd get to see an American go off because the cashier didn't smile at them or kiss their ass and it was always so funny how they'd quickly realize they were just going to get kicked out lmao,10,Why isn't banning customers from a store a thing?,Mean-Entrepreneur298,/r/antiwork/comments/qq28cw/why_isnt_banning_customers_from_a_store_a_thing/hjy4acq/,0.135,0.079,0.787,0.8458

AccidentalDM,hjy3bhf,"Everything in moderation. 

I think that’s a big problem in most of the society I’ve seen (which, granted I’m not as well traveled as I’d like to be)… I get it - life is *mind-bogglingly* complicated now, and it is so hard/stressful/time consuming trying to figure out what is the ‘best’ course of action depending on what results I’d like to get/cause from any given situation. The idea of black and white, binary thinking is so tempting because it reduces the amount of thinking/decision making I need to do.  The problem is with many things is both ‘sides’ have a shred of truth, but can turn into a problem when taken to an extreme. Same with rules - I’m a firm believer in ‘don’t break rules until you understand why they exist’, and from there ‘rules are more like guidelines anyway’. 

Who is ‘right’ in a customer/employee interaction is one of those. Both parties want/need something from the other, and both parties should make an effort to not be an ass and/or ask for something unreasonable, while working toward the common goal. The same can be said of the management/employee relationship. It’s like the difference between a symbiotic relationship vs. a parasitic relationship. Like there are some bacteria we need in our gut to digest some things, but if we eat too much of the wrong thing (like a ton of sugar) the bacteria population explodes for a bit and can cause some temporary problems until balance is restored.",3,Why isn't banning customers from a store a thing?,Mean-Entrepreneur298,/r/antiwork/comments/qq28cw/why_isnt_banning_customers_from_a_store_a_thing/hjy3bhf/,0.121,0.058,0.821,0.9494

JayGeezey,hjxucc5,"When I was in college I worked at a local pizza shop delivering pizzas, and the owner worked with us on the line - he'd black list people regularly. It was fantastic. Sometimes he'd just walk over and take the phone from you and be like ""call somewhere else"" and hang up the phone, was pretty great

At that job I also got the most ridiculous complaint from a customer I've ever had... it was a Saturday morning like 11 AM, so it's slow, guy orders pizza who lives right around the corner and no other orders are in yet so the line guy is already making the pizza before the customer is off the phone. I had the pizza at his door 15 minutes after he hangs up - FANTASTIC service, right? WRONG! **the guy calls and, I shit you not, complained that THE PIZZA WAS TOO HOT, and wanted us to bring him another one... he didn't want a refund, he just wanted another pizza... for free. The line cook had answered the call and he just says ""well, I can send my driver back out there and have him pick up your pizza and drive around while holding your pizza out the window until it cools down if you'd like?"" The dude hung up lol.**

Those are the types that the owner would black list without hesitating, it wasn't super often but it was often enough.

The liability is basically if the employer knows about the harassment and allows it to continue they could be held responsible for the harassment itself. The article I linked to sites specific case law about the issue. Harassment is illegal as part of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and allowing customer harassment to continue creates employer liability as well. This stuff I rarely enforced obviously but in the age of cell phones it really should be more.

cloutmuncher_69,hjysd5x,"Yeah the company I work for will occasionally do that, it's just in the most extreme circumstances in which customers who were aggressive towards employees are basically just given a free joint, told ""we're sorry"" and they send them on their way. Btw this is for customers who are literally yelling and getting upset at the budtenders for not having their shitty cheap weed, or not being able to give them something for free because of some fucking bullshit. It honestly has gotten to the point where if a customer is just plain rude to me I no longer help them out. My shift leaders and managers are highly aware of that now, and hopefully understand that I REFUSE to help anyone who won't show me an ounce of respect. At some points I genuinely feel as though these people just see me as a slave and I just sell them their weed and tell them ""thanks have a great rest of their day"". I'm lucky if I even get a customer who is interested in cannabis nowadays and not just looking for the cheapest, highest testing THC bud lmao. And whats crazy is that, these people forget that they cant get the weed, without me fucking helping them. So what's the point of even being rude to me, when I'm the one between you, and the trash weed you want to buy. It makes no fucking sense. And I'm sorry for such a long response and comment. But my god this has been on my mind for the past 3 months now or whatever and it just blows my mind that people refuse to show literal human beings an ounce of respect.

Unfortunate as it is,. many Employers have policies like that (for example may Grocery stores have strict policies that Employees cannot pursue thieves) .. specifically for reasons like this (not only do they not want the liability of an Employee getting injured,. but they also don't want the potential costly lawsuit if the Employee goes overboard and does something stupid in the ""heat of the moment"".

Classic-Problem,hjyn1l3,"Am a barista and can provide some context:

Three (iirc) stores in Buffalo NY had some absolutely abysmal working conditions that were never addressed or acknowledged by corporate. They won a court case that gave them the ability to vote for their stores to unionize (voting ends in December), which is a huge deal because if they do it it sets up the framework necessary for other stores across the US. But here's the problem (in corporate's eyes); once this all became huge news they shut down the stores and began retraining partners (employees) and ""apologizing"" saying ""this isn't us"" which all partners know is bullshit. They cut our covid benefits and raise the pay for new workers and not long time employees. They send us letters and videos saying that they want us to ""consider the repercussions of unionizing and why that will destroy the Starbucks partner experience."" Stores nationwide are having meetings talking about improving working conditions and training but nothing is actually changing. To appease everyone Starbucks said they will raise base pay to $15/hr... next summer. Seriously? You need to wait 8 months? 

So they haven't actually improved anything, they just keep trying to drill it into partner's heads that unionizing is bad. They don't acknowledge any problems and why the turnover rate is so high but they keep saying ""we will do better""",21,“We’re doing our part” - starfucks,PhoenixArilious,/r/antiwork/comments/qq74g7/were_doing_our_part_starfucks/hjyn1l3/,0.1,0.118,0.782,-0.7753

For the record... Fort Knox currently houses 147.3 million ounces of gold bullion.  Gold as of today is worth $1,824.53 per ounce.  This means Fort Knox is worth $268 billion dollars or about .842 of an Elon Musk.

Like I said, there are tons if valid reasons to hate Musk. He’s a scum bag. Claiming his dad is “huge in mining” is ridiculous and diminishes real complaints people have.

rezzacci,hjyhbck,"The problem isn't ""Bezos is completely self-made or not"". 

The problem is that, we keep selling the false American Dream that absolutely everybody could become a billionaire if they work hard enough. 

But the truth is: even ""self-made"" billionaires had a starting seed. Sure, he might have worked hard to create his wealth (although I'd say that *his workers worked hard* and he reaped the profits by exploiting them, but that's another debate), but he still had this starting 300k. 

I mean, I'm not that poor, I middle-class, some might even say upper-middle class. I own my own flat, I'm an engineer with a correct salary, and I'm starting to put some money aside. But I can assure that never, in the next ten years, I could have 300k to start a business. The highest amount of money I could borrow from the bank to buy my flat was 150k. They would never accept me borrowing the double of it. 

Therefore, is someone like me, some middle-class that is definitely way above the median salary, wouldn't be able to have a 300k starting seed, who do you think could have them? 

The discussion is not necessarily about the natural abilities of Bezos (albeit, yes, as I said before), but the fact that the so-called American Dream where everyone could become a billionaire ""if they just work hard enough"" is completely a lie closed to the vast majority of people. Except that, since this lie and propaganda is fed to the people, a lot of them think that *everyone* could become a billionaire, and so that a lot of people are just *temporarily embrarassed billionaires*, and therefore taxing rich people is bad because 1) they earn it only through hard work (wrong) and 2) they might become one of them.

The company developed and marketed an Internet city guide for the newspaper publishing industry, with maps, directions, and yellow pages. Musk says that before the company became successful, he could not afford an apartment and instead rented an office and slept on the couch and showered at the YMCA, and shared one computer with his brother.

franco84732,hjyl3t9,"I agree with most of what you’re saying. Like I said in my response, luck plays a huge role in a person becoming a billionaire. This is largely because it’s so hard to predict what will actually be successful in the market (many people thought Amazon was such a terrible idea that would never be profitable). I also think that the “American Dream” is flawed considering there is not equal opportunity for success based on where a person happens to be born. The only things I disagree with in your post is 1) the 300k starting seed was such a crucial aspect to the success of Amazon, 2) “Hard work is not even necessary”, and 3) The distinction between the American Dream being to become a billionaire vs millionaire vs living comfortably

1) Many people are able to raise 300k in capital relatively easily to start a company if they actually have a good idea. Furthermore, the amount of people that come from rich families that are given 300k+ to start a company or to attend college is very large. What makes Jeff Bezos’ use of the 300k to make the largest company on earth different from anyone else given that much money and do not become a Fortune 500 company? I’d say the difference in success is due to a combination of hard work, creativity, and luck. 

2) Like I said in my previous point, I think hard work is definitely a large factor in Bezos’ success. I am NOT saying this is the only factor, or even that it is the largest factor, simply that it seems to be a major factor in Amazon’s success. I think this is the case based on the competitiveness of the market. Bezos’ was competing against some of the largest corporations on earth to dominate one of the biggest sectors of the economy. Those other companies had basically unlimited money to destroy Amazon, which is why I think Amazon’s success early on must have required an insane amount of work ethic. 

3) I think it is important to understand what the “American Dream” really means. Is it realistic at all to become a billionaire even with tons of hard work? Definitely not. However, is it realistic to become a millionaire? Now it becomes a lot more obtainable (Not that it is easy, but that it it at least realistic to develop a plan of achieving that level of wealth). And if you go one step further, is it realistic to live comfortably in the U.S.? It is absolutely possible, even though some people will have a harder time achieving it since there is inequality of opportunity based on socioeconomic background. This is why I think maximizing equality of opportunity through social welfare programs would produce the most positive/fair results for society.

You can see my own views for what I think is important in society at the end of my 3rd point. I really like discussing this stuff and will absolutely admit if someone points out there is a flaw in any of my logic (this is why I post it on here, so I could hear an alternative perspective). I think I’ve made it clear enough, but I don’t think a free reign capitalist system is adequate for the success of a society. The industrial revolution (as with many other things in history) demonstrated how the lower class can be brutally exploited when the market becomes monopolized.

4AcidRayne,hjypgmr,">I wasn’t saying he is “self-made” just that it isn’t fair to characterize his achievements as simply a product of his Father’s wealth. 

Interesting point of question. Let's go down this road and say Jeffy's dad was...not there. His mom, dirt poor waitress who almost managed to get the rent paid every month or two by playing the float and kiting a check every now and then. Perhaps a little selective prostitution on the side so he could maybe get a used baseball glove for Christmas. Zero disposable wealth to give away, much less low-six-figures on a (at the time) very uncertain and ambitious idea nobody had tried.

Does Jeffy end up one of the richest men on the planet? If yes, why him and only him when the situation I've described is insanely common? When I already had his pattern to go by I couldn't get it done because of a singular pinpoint reason; I didn't have a rich daddy to throw $300,000 or even $300 at some fly-by-night scheme that may or not be profitable. 

Is Jeffy smart in coming up with the model? Absolutely. He deserves recognition for essentially spearheading a whole new business model and plan, and revolutionizing the way people buy goods. 

But...I've had rockin' ideas too, big ideas. I've designed a wildland firefighting tool concept that would be useful for every member of every hotshot crew that's ever hit the ground to fight a wildfire, lowering the weight of their kit, maximizing their field utility. Why isn't it in every firefighter's hand when they get on-scene? Why isn't my name synonymous with a tool that has saved billions of dollars worth of rich people's houses from fires? Why isn't the SketchUp file on my computer making me metric butt-tons of money? 

**Because ideas are worthless without the funding to get them off the ground.** Because without seed money, hard work and good ideas and work ethic and all that...is worth less than nothing. In the 1860s a guy named Jules had an idea, quite well fleshed out and surprisingly accurate from a scientific perspective, about how to get people to the moon, and he wrote a very good book. Unfortunately, without billions of dollars to make it go, his story served only as inspiration because it was *just an idea backed by nothing.* Money, and lots of it, got people to the moon one hundred years later. 

If Jeff had grown up in a trailer park outside Albuquerque with a mom who worked three jobs and still relied on hand-me-down bicycles from friends so he'd have one...at best, he'd have been one of the tens of thousands of guys who had a quirky little startup internet thing that never caught on, never took off, and was dead when the two-year initial ownership of the domain name expired. 

I never thought I'd see so many people on essentially an anticapitalist forum fervently defending the golden boys of capitalism, the enshrined faces of the very enemies of everything that is wrong with capitalism. ""Oh, well, 12 years worth of Walmart wage isn't that much!"" and ""Elon's dad just brokered and sold emeralds while holding a half stake in the mining machine!"" ...kinda begs the question if everybody is on the same page. 

The big question is a simple one; take your goofiest and least plausible idea, and throw hundreds of thousands of dollars at it, and ask yourself if maybe it would have succeeded with that backing? Bear in mind, for about a year people were paying $1-$500 for ""fidget spinners"" that cost ten cents to manufacture...if you can afford the machine to manufacture it. 

Ideas are dirt cheap. Many people have them. The means to put legs under those ideas and ride them onto the Forbes 500 list?

davebare,hjxnmdp,"I work in a public library. We have a lot of people who come in needing (for the first time) to apply for benefits or a new job online. The last time they applied for a job, in many cases, emails, the Internet and computers where only used by people who worked at IBM and they used a pencil and a paper.

They are threatened immediately upon arrival. They are feeling extremely inadequate. They're scared. They get really frustrated. Our state has a service that helps people get work by helping them create email accounts, navigate the terrifying online realm of getting a new job, etc. but they don't even know how to get in contact with that service.

The fact is, I've seen this play out and it is not fun or pleasant for the people in positions like mine who have to help them. And it doesn't help them see things from a new perspective.

People who are suffering from feelings of inadequacy are actually far more likely to be defensive, lose patience, be angry, get violent, because they realize that they haven't caught up with things and it is terrifying for them. They feel that they are being marginalized and many (who only have a HS degree and who have worked at the mill since the early 1980s) feel completely alienated.

Their response is to be haughty and priggish and hateful. They say things online that they think will help to hide their lack of self-confidence (after all, I can use a Facebook profile, so that means I'm technologically savvy, right?).

To see this unfold in a public place is to watch someone who is actually suffering a bad melt down. Do I think it would be fun to watch to ""own the boomers""? No. It is horrible to watch and anyone with a shred of humanity left in them would think so too.

Does it justify how stupid and impossible they are about their ""Just go to work like I did"" mentality? No. Does it atone for their ridiculous behavior toward young people for whom work really does suck? No. Should we validate their behavior? No. They are being ridiculous, but there is a reason and when it comes to them being faced with the difficulties that the rest of us deal with in the new world of work, they do very badly indeed. It has required in several situations police intervention. With one person, I thought he was going to go home and shoot himself, because he very seriously said to me that he didn't know what the point of living was.

That's a hopelessness that I really don't think helps our cause. If anyone knows the trauma of the work world, it is the Boomer generation. They pretend to be tough and hard, but they hated work as much as we do, they've just forgotten. The point would be to win them to the cause by sympathizing with them and showing them just how much harder it is now, not by mocking and alienating them. Are they horrible? Yes. Can they be of help? Some can.

Yes, some cannot be reached, but I come from a very long line of blue-collar workers (I'm my family's first ""white collar"" worker) and they know quite well how much work really sucks. They are certainly anti-work, and those who are dead now, would line up too, if they weren't.",1,Opinion,SheriePor,/r/antiwork/comments/qpuet7/opinion/hjxnmdp/,0.083,0.198,0.72,-0.998

Ramenordie,hjxrn5m,"I’m millennial in my mid 30’s with health conditions derived from a previous workplace. I know firsthand how disgusting employers are towards people. From 23 I was told too young for something or too old for something else. From 25 I was told too old. 

I’ve sent hundreds and hundreds of resumes out, made it into top 5 candidates hundreds of times. I’ve had 8 interviews over phone or face to face In 11.5 years

I left one job because of my health. Another because they made everyone redundant except me and I kept getting told by the CEO that we’ll have a meeting about my higher duties allowance. 

Another took advantage of my health conditions and got a kickback for having a ‘disabled’ employee even though I don’t consider myself disabled. They did that without asking me how I felt about it first. Then when they were bleeding money I was shown the door. 

Another job I was just blatantly taken advantage of. 

One interview I was asked what I know about diversity in the workplace. Asked that By two white males in trade roles and a middle aged white female in an admin role. Yeah a fucking panel unqualified to ask that question being asked to a person considered legally disabled and with a clearly non-Anglo surname. 

Another interview I still want to punch the labourer that interviewed me and illegally asked about my health condition and giving off a facial expression that quantified deserving a violent response. 

I’m overqualified, I’m under qualified. I don’t have references because I lost touch with people, it’s been more than a decade, they’re untrustworthy or have a terrible name themselves. 

I’m now studying 3 seperate degrees because I just want to be educated and maybe use them myself to build something where people don’t have to put up with these kinds of jokes in job seeking or the workplace. Maybe I’ll be successful, maybe I won’t.

I don’t even think 3 months is enough to fully understand how miserable it is - they need to understand what it’s like when your apartment has insufficient heating AND cooling. Go for a year.

Make them pick what apartment AND car payment they’re going to spend that budget on. The 1 bedroom on 300 South for $600/month plus utilities where someone’s going to break in and steal the ancient stereo right out of the dash of your Toyota Camry? That’ll help you afford your insulin, but those single pane windows make it real cold in the winter, and an electric blanket is more than what you want to spend on groceries. Or would they rather have the 1 bedroom on Main Street where they have a parking garage, and utilities are included, but it’s 1,200 a month, the upstairs neighbor watches his porn a little too loudly at 1AM, and they’re going to be eating poverty chips (dry ramen crunched up in the bag with the flavor packet) for two of their three meals a day because they picked the Nissan Sentra with a $170/month car payment instead of the Geo Prizm they could afford to buy outright? Don’t worry, Mitch… if you can’t afford to repair the transmission right now, you can always get a bus pass and enjoy the experience of having a meth head pee on the floor in front of you. Maybe you just take the bus for a couple months to save on gas, and when you’ve finally scrounged up the money, you can feel the joy of handing over a few months of hard sacrifice to pay for that repair on a piece of shit you don’t even want to drive.

I miss my Geo Prizm. It got about double the gas mileage of what I currently drive, and that’s the only reason I was able to drive to work for the first two weeks of my new job when I was having medical emergencies and my credit/debit were maxed out and over-drafted and I had to go about 3.5 weeks without a paycheck to get out of the call center job that was putting me in the ER.

I fully believe that your average billionaire could go from nothing to millionaire faster than the average person.

Banks would be lining up to give him business loans, venture capitalists would be calling him nonstop. At least for a while, if he played his cards right he would be able to rebuild a substantial chunk of wealth. Probably not back to his Amazon peak, but he'd definitely be mid tier rich. He has the experience and education to make a lot of money in business, and he would have the contacts to get the capital he needs to get the mill grinding - the part that's actually missing for most people.

But unless the rules of this ""show"" allow him to call in old favors, he won't be able to go from $200 and a cell phone to millionaire in any reasonable timeframe.

After a while i realized i was basically volunteering and was forced to quit.

I explained this to my boss and she seemed genuinely annoyed. Gave me this look like, *what do you mean taking the only taxi in town to the bus station and then taking the bus to work, then the bus and taxi home, and spending 50% of your daily paycheck to work here isn't ""working out""?* Like dude you should be thanking me for going through all of that just to get here in the first place. I could have quit the second I moved, but I stayed because you needed the help. Give me longer hours and/or higher pay and maybe i can afford to fucking work here.

Actually, no, I should have quit the day of my car accident. I'd been driving to work and I called her while waiting for the police and told her I couldn't work today because I was in an accident and really shaken up. She later made a post on FB whining about how she worked a double without a break that day and she was soooo thankful that a friend of ours brought her some pizza for lunch. I commented on it and said, ""I'm really sorry you had to work so long today, but as you know, I was in an accident on my way to work this morning and totaled my grandma's car. I spent the the rest of the morning at the police station, and by the time I got home I would have had 2 hours left of my scheduled shift.

District managers were the ones who had power to do things like make schedules, make personnel decisions, etc. and they werent ever in the store or anything.

It always made me laugh when someone wanted to speak to the manager and shed stop doing whatever she was doing and just read off one of the 5 precanned responses and then give them a gift card or something.

And it was like that at a bunch of other stores i worked at although not as pronounced. 90% of 'managers' in retail are just regular people doing a job and trying not to get fired, its the 10% who think theyre defending the power of the store that give us things to laugh at.",2,Opinion,SheriePor,/r/antiwork/comments/qpuet7/opinion/hjy798v/,0.098,0.011,0.891,0.954

KeredNomrah,hjxsnhe,"Ahh I see, I can understand how the psyche ward can be confusing.  The sad truth is it doesn’t take a totalitarian state for this to be the truth (some would argue a lot of countries are already there in action but not name).

Psyche ward placement can be done for many reasons of which don’t have to be sane.  Parent claims the child wants to harm themselves? Psyche ward.  Parents claim he’s violent towards others, psyche ward.  This doesn’t even have to happen in front of the child.  I mean it’s a common theme in media for people to be locked up incorrectly and there’s articles all day long.  Hell, look at the recent “free Britney” escapade.  It’s a sad state of affairs, the minute your child is even considered for a ward all parental control is gone and the process takes over.  If anything someone might’ve placed the individual if they saw signs of abuse from the parent but they can’t directly make accusations.  Within a structured process environment, the right professional may be able to help and have that person open up.

In short, when it comes to the psych ward anything is possible including worse outcomes.",1,Opinion,SheriePor,/r/antiwork/comments/qpuet7/opinion/hjxsnhe/,0.029,0.175,0.796,-0.989

But when society places hundreds of proletarians in such a position that they inevitably meet a too early and an unnatural death, one which is quite as much a death by violence as that by the sword or bullet; when it deprives thousands of the necessaries of life, places them under conditions in which they cannot live — forces them, through the strong arm of the law, to remain in such conditions until that death ensues which is the inevitable consequence — knows that these thousands of victims must perish, and yet permits these conditions to remain, its deed is murder just as surely as the deed of the single individual; disguised, malicious murder, murder against which none can defend himself, which does not seem what it is, because no man sees the murderer, because the death of the victim seems a natural one, since the offence is more one of omission than of commission.

DiscountWHM,hjz8ns3,"God I hate this. Support services do everything in their power to treat you like you're just trying to leech. To the point where I think it's just assumed all clients are. I've struggled to pay my rent the last couple months. I'm actually not supposed to be working, but they didn't accept my doctor's note because my doctor cannot give a specific date for when I'll be better. My problem won't just go away, it's complicated and involved seeing different specialists and I'm facing the only potential therapy that might be too expensive for me to afford because it's not covered by health benefits. It's not even a guarantee it would work, either. The lady on the phone asked me why I can attend online school but not work. Apparently having an air filtered room, being able to sit upright all day (best position for me) and be right next to my medications vs not any of that is a goddamn mystery.

I've done this rodeo before though and sensed they'd cut off my support so I went and found a job. Yup, they cut my support. Had to borrow money from a friend that month for rent. Couldn't really afford food though, had to wait for first paycheck that wasn't even correct, so the next month was tough too. Support says they'll re-examine my case once I get a proof of employment letter. I asked my work 3 weeks ago for one, it went to HR. Don't know what the fuck HR gets paid for but apparently it's not taking 5 minutes out of their day to confirm someone works there. Next month will also be tough.

I just got sick from my work with a common flu, because I had to check vaccination proof from people and not all believed in science. Well since I have other complications with severe allergy and asthma, I couldn't work for *two weeks*. I will always develop bronchitis and have major asthma attacks following catching a cold or flu and lasts for at least a week. Working fast food means I never have stable pay because I constantly catch colds/flus from customers, apparently even when we have masks and sanitizer. I just applied for support for the weeks I missed (different benefit), but when I was previously accepting a different different benefit months ago, they never closed that file so the different benefit people think I'm on different different benefit so I'm not eleigible for it either.

Not sure if I can stably pay for rent and food, all because one fucking dumbass lady couldn't understand why I can attend online school but not work in a germ riddled environment without access to medications and filtered air. I only needed to be on it for a year before I could attend full time school and get my diploma....

>Since leaving London Metropolitan University in May 2008, she had been claiming Job Seekers Allowance, but her benefits were stopped 6 months into her pregnancy because she was considered unable to work. As a result, she also lost her automatic entitlement to housing benefit.  
She was advised to apply for income support, but her application was rejected because the Department for Work and Pensions said she had not proven that she had been in continuous employment in the UK for the previous 5 years, despite having been in either education or employment since 1997.  
Her application for child benefit was also then rejected after officials learnt she had been denied income support, and Hackney council demanded that she repay £200 in housing benefit.  
Two further appeals for income support were rejected when her attempts to take the DWP to a tribunal failed after she was repeatedly failed to be given a date for a hearing.

FerrisTriangle,hjyr5nt,"This analysis is almost correct.

What the capitalist ruling class wants most of all is a surplus of people looking for work. 

One of the most powerful pieces of leverage that an employer has to depress your wages is the threat of replacing you with someone more desperate and willing to work for scraps. After all, how can you negotiate for the full value of your labor of there is someone else who is struggling to survive and willing to take that job for pennies on the dollar just so they can put food on the table.

Looking at this from a morbid perspective, if unemployment were actually a death sentence then there would suddenly be no surplus labor pool that your employer could threaten to replace you with. That would give you bargaining power to negotiate for wages that better represent the value of your labor, which would then cut into your employers profit margin because now they have to pay you what you're worth instead of pocketing the fruits of your labor for themselves.

So you're correct that the point of unemployment and job seekers programs is not to make sure that everyone has a job. Its to make sure that you're miserable enough that you keep looking for a job, so that you can be used as a threat that prevents current employees from being able to negotiate for better wages without being fired and replaced.

This results in unemployment and job seekers benefits being calibrated and means tested so that they can keep most people alive, but degrading enough to keep people so miserable and desperate that they will continue looking for work. 

Of course policy makers don't care if the occasional person dies as a result of these conditions. They need the threat of homelessness and starvation to be real and meaningful in order to push people into wage labor agreements that are just barely better than death.

This is what happens when your government represents capitalist class interests.",5,Pushed from the Cliff!,ruiseixas,/r/antiwork/comments/qq4xct/pushed_from_the_cliff/hjyr5nt/,0.088,0.144,0.768,-0.9765

If I agree with every single point everyone is making, but no one agrees with me, that means I'm failing to get my point across effectively because people are seeing me in a different light. 

Some are reading it as I am blaming the mother for her choice, she is not to blame, the system is.

Some see it as me being a sadist and want her and her baby to struggle, which is also not what i'm saying because there is cruelty in the system that forced this mother to the point she got to.

You see it as me trying to waste time and ignore others, but that's not what i'm doing, i'm expanding on the conversation so that I can understand better so in the future I can be more clear and sincere. I'm not some bot that has calculated orders to argue, I want to discuss different POV's to understand my own and others better.

WeekendMechanic,hjzavs5,"This happened at my last job, except I had been there around a year and I did get about two months of training in before my manager fucking died while on vacation.

They asked me to take over his normal duties (which I already did on the weekends) full time. My supervisors put in that they wanted me to be promoted to the position (with all its perks/salary), but the off-site HR group decided to drag their feet for as long as possible, then started posting the job and began a ""hiring process"" that I had to apply and interview for. I think it took them like four months before they called me with a ridiculously lowball offer (think $10,000-$15,000 less than the other two managers), which I had to rebuttal since the shift I was taking over was the least staffed and had the heaviest workload.

I ended up taking their second offer, which was still too low for the work I was doing.

Sorry, pal, if your store is selling $14,000/weekly in clear profit after expense and overhead, and your overhead cuts that down to $12,000 weekly in clear profit after expense and overhead...the $2,000 you're ""losing"" doesn't give you free reign to jack prices up that create $18,000 clear. It's, in the grand scheme, a negligible expense, comparable to a marginal increase on lighting cost.

We saw it here locally a few years ago. My state added a tax on cigarettes to increase the per-unit (pack) tax 70 cents, $7 increase on a carton. So, if a carton would cost $32 before the tax, it'd cost $39 after, right? Wrong. That carton that cost $32 was listed at $48. $16 increase in response to a $7 tax. A lot of people blamed the state and bitched about the state to the store owners who were nodding and passing the blame whilst pocketing $9 in extra profit.

Through tax cuts and subsidies and bailouts, we built this savings into their profits. We pay taxes for WalMart to have the most people on state welfare working for them. Then subsidize them during covid while they make billions and get a tax credit on any losses. They took their tax cuts and threw them into stock buybacks and those became their new profit margin. Profits are almost always % increase year over year, and so now you have companies that are only existing because of the percentage of our wages we indirectly throw back into their profits while also paying for the damages their low wages have on our society. 

Fuck the price increase, it's an illusion. We already pay to subsidize servers getting paid a liveable wage. We pay for companies to avoid taxes. We pay for workers to have their benefits actually exist. We pay to bail out poor oversight of their management. Don't fear these price increases.

SnooChocolates3415,hjxyowk,"I honestly don’t believe the minimum wage should be raised at all. This may be the boomer in me talking, but minimum wage isn’t supposed to provide you with a lot and for that reason it’s minimum wage. 

Do people expect to be making great money working a minimum wage job? I understand the minimum living lifestyle but don’t expect living in a house or owning a car or anything considered “luxurious” while making that minimal pay. 

I worked my ass off with minimal wage pay for a few years before I realized I can’t keep living this lifestyle. Renting a small bedroom for 800 a month in Miami. Living paycheck to paycheck. Just barely being able to scrap on by. I went from making $10 an hour to $15 an hour. 

It’s not that high of a jump, but it’s alot better than where I started out. I can afford a few more luxuries now because of it.

 Everything in life I can say is due to progression. If you’re comfortable making $10 an hour and you’re able to make that work, that’s great. I hated busting my ass in a labor intensive job that paid me scraps. Through that work I was able to get myself involved in a trade. Now, I’m entry level in this trade but it’s a hell of a lot easier than before and I’m making better pay. 

I know this is r/antiwork but I can’t justify the minimum wage pay being raised because now the only thing that will happen is inflation.

When checking the inflation rates for the last 30 years, you can even see that inflation in 2015 **and** 2016, the year after introducing minimum wage, was significantly lower than average. Feel free to have a look for yourself: https://www.finanz-tools.de/inflation/inflationsraten-deutschland

So when business owners don't have facts on their side for this bs propaganda, they'll just try to create new ""facts"". 

This won't work though because this will be a perfect opportunity for reasonable business owners to attract new customers by simply **not raising prices**, so the only thing unreasonable (i.e. greedy) business owners will achieve long term, is going out of business.",1,"Ontario is increasing minimum wage to $15/hr in the new year.

Now that same property, 4 years later is probably worth around 500k.   I left and moved to Ohio, built a new house here in a really nice place..the housing prices here are normal and far more stable.  

I'm trying to encourage my daughter to leave Windsor and move to the US since she has dual citizenship.  She's literally afraid to leave because she has a 2 bedroom apartment that costs her around $650/month since she got it in 2011...right now, units in her area her size are going for at least $1200-1400/month.  She wouldn't be able to afford that...and she'll never be able to save and qualify for a house with what she makes...which isn't a terrible salary but nowhere near enough to save a down payment in the next decade.

I told her just to move.  Luckily where I live, housing is still affordable and the job market is excellent.  And since Covid, I work from home which are a lot of the jobs here.

I do. It’s not a cure-all by any means, but it’s a start and a way to maintain livable wages when cost-of-living and inflation fluctuates.

>Strong unions and a decent housing system (restrict ownership to residence only, etc.) are the best.

Unions are subject to corrupt leadership. Restriction to residence is interesting, but not feasible or practical. Teenagers or fresh-out-of high-school adults at the minimum wage should be able to afford rent.

>Sweden's Folkhemmet never had a national minimum wage at all. 

Different countries have different dynamics. 

>But strong unions mean there is an effective one in almost all industries, and the first-hand contracts system (back then, before neoliberalism, mass immigration and 12+ year queues) meant every worker could rent at a good price.

Now the grocery store in the ""bad part"" of town gets shit for help because it's all section 8 housing. Now that store has no one working for them because they all went to work in the ""good part"" of town. Grocery store closes. Now neighborhood has no grocery store.

What's to stop areas from creating ""low income housing"" that effectively drives wages down?

Wouldn't it be easier to de-incentivise living in population centers not only generate more wealth for all (new businesses, homes, uplifting of small town economies, etc), but also lower housing prices *while sticking it to the ""man"" that owns 25 slum like rental properties?*

But the fact is we do, and we will for some time until our technological level evolves to when many more jobs can be automated. Unless we want to regress back to the days of yore when people owned their own farms and lived in little hovels reading the bible by candlelight.

Personally I’d rather continue to spend my nights watching youtube and playing video games.

The best option at our current state is UBI for basic living necessities and let all the other stuff keep innovating as it has. Over time more and more jobs will be automated and we can eventually not have “work” anymore

Forcing it now would just have jobs no one “wants” to do like cleaning septic systems, dealing with garbage, or other jobs that right now most people take because in general they pay well because people don’t want them.

Otherwise people will be forced to do certain jobs to fill the gap and we went from “slave labor” to straight up “slave”",2,"Ontario is increasing minimum wage to $15/hr in the new year.

You would just need to draw lines and make them big enough to benefit the masses and decrease business ability to move its business and benefit. Lines to small they move.

Aurick_411,hjxkk37,"if right now the means to production was given back to every citizen we’d be fucked.  People wouldn’t know what to do.  People, by nature, are greedy and selfish - it’s instinctual.  People would only care about themselves and maybe some close people around them and would only do whatever suited them.  

Sure, some people might want to do “what’s good for humanity” or “what needs to be done” but they wouldn’t be the majority and they would be strained and would eventually resent the people who decided their time was better spent doing things like trying to write a book or create an art piece.  

Going back to the point I made, certain jobs (which aren’t production jobs, they are service jobs) aren’t things they want to do.  Capitalism doesn’t block people from cleaning their own septic tanks.  People just take their trash for a drive and dump it somewhere else (usually illegally) all the time.  Those are service jobs.  If people owned the means to production, those jobs still need to be done.  But by who?  Are you going to Force people to do the job because someone has too if no one wants to do it “for the good of humanity” in an area?

Mild--47,hjvqgob,"So check this out.

The biggest nonsense requirement for entry level portions is “experience.” Which is what makes the first job in any field you pick the hardest.

It will make your fucking head spin how quickly you will get picked up at other jobs after you quit, because now you have that fabled “experience.” They almost always pay more, provided its in a relatively similar field. And this result seems to compound. So when you leave that second job, your third will pay more than that.

Basically what I am saying is to quit your bullshit jobs immediately and more often than not, there is a better one just around the corner.

They want you to think your stuck. All they do is lie. The whole basis of the work economy is lies and secrets. Don’t believe them. Believe this sub.

SlyFoxInACave,hjwoy3x,This happened to me and my one coworker that stuck around. We were working two whole shifts consecutively and if we even tried to mention we were tired from working 12-13 hour shifts 5-6 days a week they would threaten to drop us down to part time and demote us. We were one of the most vital employees because without us and our tasks the company literally could not function. I finally walked out and told them I would no longer be working more than 8 hours at a time and anything after that is on my own accord. They obviously weren't replacing the people that quit and they could NOT afford to lose even just me. It worked out in the end because I love my position and still have it. I work about 9 hours at a time and have since not been asked to stay late or threatened with any bullshit.

The CEO makes a half million dollars a year and just took a 12k bonus (NONPROFIT WORK) the next highest earner at the company makes 200k, public record.

It went from the HR lady begging me to stay an extra week to the next day, finding out they're making my last day that Friday via the owner's personal assistant crying and saying how much she was gonna miss me. I walked into HR and asked them if they had anything they needed to tell me.

They said oh yeah, we don't want you to work past Friday... But we'll pay you for the 2 weeks anyway. 

Lolol. Was fucking amazing!

serioususeorname,hjvytpn,"I honestly think this happened to me.

I was a wicked heavy second in command of a big department. I had applied to be prompted to the head of a small a department two times. Those small departments would have been easy places to cut my teeth as a department head, but I got passed over for those two department head jobs. But I got a call from HR six months later essentially offering me a promotion to another ""small"" department. Found out when I took the job that the department was a dumpster fire and the department head had been doing the work for 4 or 5 people and the available staff was incompetent. They were small at first blush but were doing an insanely high amount of business during certain periods. I found a note behind the desk from the previous department head's spouse saying they hoped things would get better and that they were sure they'd get another job soon. Everything that could be wrong with a department at that corporation was indeed wrong. It was nuts. I left as soon I could. Took 14 months. It honestly ruined part of my life. It was like they refused to change anything because it was so bad. 

Edits due to dm questions: I repeatedly tried to get help from higher up the chain but was basically told it was all my fault. They refused to accept that the staff was too small in number and that they were grossly not right for the position. Not to be ageist but they were near retirement and refused to learn how to do anything new. And that had been going on forever. Which is why the previous department head was doing it all on their own. I even made a preservation outlining how the department was not getting the support it needed. Was told it didn't matter due to budgets. I stupidly plowed ahead tried to do it all in my own AND increased the amount of business at the same time AND improved some other areas as I had been tasked to do when promoted. I really thought they'd give me more staff. Never did. I left. The Corp went through 3 new department heads in three years after me, and from what I understand they now have central admin from the Corp doing a lot of what the head admin in the department used to do. They just didn't listen. Plus I think the administrator before me screwed everyone by being too quiet and subservient to the higher up admin and not sounding the alarm. After I left their level of activity went back down. It's still bigger than it should be for their size. But they could be doing 2 or 3 times as much.",5,Everyone's quitting at my job.

Then the divisional head retired, and it was between our technical manager and the ops manager to replace him.  The ops manager got the job and within a week the tech manager put in his notice, realising he'd hit the ceiling there.

Everyone in our department was shocked.  We figured it really meant things were going downhill if a lifer quit.  And we all knew our protector in the great game of restructuring wasn't going to be around any more.  

I went home the night he quit, talked to my wife and put in my notice the next day.  One of the other two team leads put in his notice that same day as well.  And it snowballed.  I guess it was even a bigger shock for the teams that two of the team leads had followed the boss.  So one by one they put in their notice as well.

I kept in touch with an ex-colleague who still worked there after I left.  He said our department shrank for 18 to 6 in six months with everyone quitting, and nothing ever got done because those who were left were too overworked.",6,Everyone's quitting at my job.

GoldenSatchel,hjw3wjl,"We did trade work for printing companies. Ran several very old Heidelberg and Kluge presses. Foil stamping, embossing, die cutting, book binding. Also major massive folding/gluing work on very expensive, newer machines. Not rocket science, but not just something you can throw an ad for in the paper and have a guy there the next week. 

At one point months prior they had to fly two guys out from Ontario (we were in Alberta) to help. All expenses paid, signing bonus, made way more than us we found out. One guy didn't work out pretty quickly, the other took a few months to shit the bed, and we were back to the two of us. 

Boss had been convicted of molesting his son's friend, and then it got even weirder and shittier, and as soon as the main guy gave notice I couldn't fathom staying there. Super toxic work environment. Constant pay battles, they would never pay overtime, only bank time... so I gave a big fuck you sandwich to that, which made my last few months pretty testy. They told me if I wouldn't bank time I could leave after 8 hours, which I gladly did. Had a new wife sitting at home in a new city, we could use the money but if I'm not at least getting some overtime, bite me. I'd casually walk out after my 8 hours at 3pm and wish everyone a good day with a big smile, and they'd be there until after supper... or bedtime.

His kids then started to work there and one would leave sexually inappropriate caricatures of the main guy and I around the work area. Best was a very detailed one of me bent over the press working, with him uhhh, behind me. With the recent court activity of the owner this was not exactly the best idea. The other guy would photocopy this shit and confront the owner, with the originals stashed away for future reference. 

One of them went to business school and implemented shit that made us crazy, he had zero experience in the field. We spent more time making these charts accounting for every minute of the day so they could check for areas to improve. I would have to write shit like:

8:05 to 8:11  mount embossing die

8:11 to 8:16 mix mould 

8:16 to 8:19 apply mould 

So after a while I started adding a line after every single item accounting for how long it took me to write it down. I'd have two dozen one or two minute blocks dedicated to ""walk to bench, write down time spent, walk back to press"". They didn't appreciate it. lol

I never once saw a review or pay raise, and when I'd ask I'd get non-answers. Found a different job that paid me 8 bucks more per hour. When I put in my 2 weeks I was *immediately* called in for a review. I got 'top marks' and if I would stay they'd give me a 2(!) dollar raise.

I straight up told him what I would be making at the new place and he told me he couldn't match it. Then he asked what he could do to keep me around, and I said ""You could have offered me this raise after a year and 2 reviews, and I'd have stayed"".

And 2 - and this is the key - I am thought of someone who works slow and steady.. so any time my employer fucked something up or screwed up scheduling meaning something needs to be done right now, im not the guy they call.. if you want it done right, you call me.. if you want it fast you call someone else..

Most people I know, or have heard stories of in this role usually like the work they do, just hate the job (aka the ppl, politics, bs, managers etc). So by being a contractor you avoid all that while making enough that you're very happy.

  you can go all scorched earth if you want, but the situation that arises from these scenarios can be extremely beneficial, even life changing, like another commenter explained about his friend doing similar. At the end of the day it's up to you.

I mean if it was me I'd gladly be a smug asshole and go back knowing my former asshole manager gets to see me come in at leisure as I make way more money than I use to without him being able to say shit. If itd take 10x for you to step back in the office/job, than that's your number.",6,Everyone's quitting at my job.

drewster23,hjwakm0,"Love it.

I hope more ppl see these comments and recognize it as an option if they're in similar scenario.

The company either laughs or baffles at your now ""absurd request"", so ok fuck you whatever im still gone (guess you dont need me) nothing changes. 

Or they pony up and pay because they do need you, and now you make more and are free from office bs and politics. No manager is going to want to waste your time or bother you when you're making bank for all the time there. And if someone actually does want to waste your time or actually needs to, then it'd nbd because you're getting paid enough to be fine with it.  

You become an external integral solution instead of a cog in the machine. And companies always seem to value those solutions more than their cogs.

ManyFacedGodxxx,hjvrir8,"Yep, I had that happen to me… We had a newer employee who hadn’t done much of anything yet besides take over existing work (which he did well) and run his mouth. Because the boss “liked him” they gave him a $12k raise (mind you this was 20+ years ago!) Even more brilliant, you can decipher everyone’s pay so we saw right away he gotten a raise and he was now making more than people that had proven track records, sold jobs, worked them and expanded while this guy had done none of that.

I had my annual review before all this went down, all was well I was a model employee. A month after his raise I went to the boss and said “…hey, this is all the work I’m doing, all that’s signed, in the pipeline etc, I deserve more pay.” “Nope, we feel you’re getting what you deserve…”

Little did they know I had another job lined up, 30% pay increase, better benefits, international company, etc. So the following week I turn in my two weeks notice. THEN all of the sudden they realize they’re screwed and can’t really back fill me and everything going on, then they wanted to talk about a “slight raise.” HA!

So I leave with the highest profits in the division documented; and then all of the other project managers were allowed to “raid” my profits to make their numbers look better and I became the bad guy. They dragged my name through the mud, I was terrible, exaggerated my numbers, blah, blah. Of course I had friends still there so they told me this, and word got around and that company did even more damage to it’s already shaky reputation in the process. Within a three month period that company lost seven key employees in that division BUT the management of course kept their jobs; hilarious!

Again sadly, that is all it is to him, just a prize to validate his ""Macy's Day Parade float"" level of inflated ego. No concept of it being a role of serving the nation.
( I do understand that it requires a pretty big ego to go for the top job, but never have I seen such a massive ego with so little to actually warrant it)

To be clear he really is a colossal cunt. Completely incompetent, devoid of any empathy, completely lacking in leadership and ideas that might advance our nation. Beholden to the fossil fuel industry he serves only them, a handful of special interest groups and himself. He has failed upwards his entire career and it is a real tragedy that we find ourselves in a situation that he is running the show. Perhaps more accurately taking up space and not running the show because he doesn't seem to do much in the way of actually governing.

I could go on to provide some opinion based criticism but maybe best to just leave it at the verifiable facts. I'm sure history will judge him to be one of the saddest excuses for a prime minister that this nation has ever had the burden and embarrassment of enduring. 

May the end to the blight of his government be near, for as resilient as we are as a country, this fuck has his foot on the fossil fuel pedal, flat to the floor, and has the entire earth aimed towards a cliff.

Would tip me 25 cents if I “didn’t give her attitude”. 
I loved being able to tell people off in that environment, I developed a very thick skin. 
My favorite memory has to be the guy who threatened to kill me while I was bartending. Can’t remember what prompted it, but he was picked up and thrown outside by the doormen. For a week he begged and begged to be let back in, my boss said he needed to ask me if it was ok. I thought what the hell, and let him back in. Not 15 min later he threatened to kill me again, and he was again thrown outside. He came running back inside a couple min later begging to use the bathroom, we said gtfo again. My door man goes out side a minute later to smoke and catches this guy taking a shit right next to our front door! Lol oh man. Doorman said he pushed him over into his poop and chased him off. I saw him only a few more times after that, he would give strangers money and stand on the corner waiting for them to buy him off sale. Like dude, there’s about 13 liquor stores within .5 miles of this one, go somewhere else. Good times! I didn’t even call police on him for any of this, I just chalked it up to be ok weirdo get out of here. Got paid about $8 an hour plus tips for putting up with this shit.

bubbleyum92,hjwo48b,"Jesus Christ. 

I was just watching a video last night of some lady screaming at a drive through worker for like AN HOUR. This lady had already gotten two meal replacements for whatever fuck up she claimed happened but she was not happy with anything they offered. When she finally got her THIRD free meal, she insisted the worker take back the other two because they were wrong and she wasn't going to eat them. The worker didn't want them and this pissed the lady off even more, that the worker was refusing to take back the food.

When the lady finally left she said she wasn't even going to eat the third ""correct"" meal because who knows what the worker did to it. Like what is your end goal here???

All of this to say I think I'm starting to understand that some of these psychopaths just want to be mad and scream at someone. It doesn't matter whether their issue is fixed or if the worker is apologetic and immediately tries to right the situation. There is no ""fix"" for their problem because their problem is that they are miserable and they want other people to be miserable too. And the only people they can take this out on are low level workers that have to put up with their bullshit. I feel so bad for people that have to deal with these asshats, I don't think I could stay at a job where this happens. How do you even deal with someone like that, who only wants to hurt you?

aehii,hjxdx8o,"Christ, where do you live? 

The comedian who did those funny IKEA videos said something I agree with, people feel powerless in their life and the only time they can feel power is as a consumer when demanding as a customer. It's an obvious point maybe and it doesn't excuse the behaviour at all. It's like throwing litter, something which I cannot understand at all.  I saw a girl once walk with a slush then dropped it 5 metres before a bin. Again the easy take is laziness and not caring about the environment, but most people see the cities they live in as awful deprived places. Unless people have pride in the places they live they will treat it with little care. We evolved as a species in forests and connected to nature, now we're surrounded by concrete. 

I was taking photos of pigeons the other day and a man asked 'why are you taking photos of them horrible creatures?' I said 'aww they're not'. 'They're like rats with wings' he said. Because they're grey animals that live in cities. They're more like miniature dinosaurs than rats with wings but they're grey rather than bright multicoloured and live in horrible cities so therefore they're horrible. 

I still feel awkward over my interaction with staff the other day, this will be comparatively lame but I was in Southampton UK...I was in a small arcade, it was 20 minutes until closing. There was only another kid in there talking to the one staff. I was playing Tekken on a machine with no seat. There was a taped off section to my left with a seat and having a bad back I hate standing still. You can't pause the game and I was losing, I quickly dragged the seat over to use and the staff guy said 'you can't do that, someone might want to use it, if you'd asked it would be fine but you cant just move chairs around'. I pushed it back, soon lost and left. I only moved it because they were about to close and no one was gonna use it. 

I think that might be the most boring story of all time. I'm going to tell others and do a survey.

The way he said 'you can't just move chairs around', with apparent disbelief. When it's empty and you're closing in 15 minutes who cares?",41,Nobody wants to work!,rutoca,/r/antiwork/comments/qpr56g/nobody_wants_to_work/hjxdx8o/,0.083,0.143,0.774,-0.9859

aehii,hjygrsj,"Hmm I dunno, he was the only staff there, it was a small arcade, like living room size. I think it's just people get particular with things being where they are. I dunno if I wrote it correctly, the seat was next to me, I didn't have to move to fetch it. And the screen on the Tekken game was high anyway so it didn't help. 

Maybe he'd grown attached to this young kid asking him questions all day and thought he might play the machine the seat was taken from, but I doubt that, while I was there he didn't play anything, and other kids on dance revolution left. 

I couldn't really work out why it was taped off and you needed to ask to go in there, another sign of being particular, like it's not a public arcade but the personal bedroom of the staff member. Half of the taped part was consoles though with bean bags, the other half two machines. 

I sometimes wonder if I'm an unfortunate example used in anecdotes. I don't mind, the antagonist in another's story. Whether it's with driving or doing street photography. 'Oh god this guy today!!!' I'm not a bad reckless driver but even now my van is limp mode and hasn't the power to go uphill so people might be miffed. 

And with street it's inevitable. I came out of a swimming pool, went to my van, saw what looked like an abandoned car in the car park full of clothes and books, multiple tickets issued on windscreen, clothes in baskets next to it. An hour left on parking, I'll just get my camera...this car had clothes crammed into the drivers seat, there's no way it could be driven. A minute later a woman walks up and says 'hello this is my car it's my private property can you delete all those photos please'. 'I'm a photographer I thought it was abandoned'. 'Well it's not I've just seen a friend'. I know most will take the subject's wish but I'm big on regret so hate missing shots, I will spend hours thinking about it.

Yes, I do know how ridiculous and fake that sounds and yet all of it is absolutely true.

Phone calls went unreturned. When I tried visiting in person they put me in a waiting room and never came to get me. It took two months and my insurance company badgering them to wrangle a police report out of them.)

dog_snack,hjye32a,"I’m not American either—je suis canadien, mais anglo—but our labour laws and work culture here are largely similar, maybe a little bit better. Still not nearly as good as France, from the sound of it. 

Many people here are simply ignorant that things are better in other developed countries. Until recently I worked in the service industry mostly as a cashier at a burger restaurant, and I would occasionally say to my coworkers “you know, if this were in Germany, we’d get a chair“. And it’s little things like that that we are ignorant of and we assume that what we do is normal. For us, it’s normal to have to stand up for 7 1/2 hours a day and go home with sore feet. I guess part of it also the so-called “Protestant work ethic” (France is a Catholic country, right?); if you’re sitting down the whole time, are you really working? Not unless you work in an office.

Conservative people in general also like to put the idea in our heads that asking for “ too much“ is ridiculous. It’s common for even liberal shows and movies to portray unions as ridiculous. This is deliberate, to make those who demand better for themselves seem “whiny“.

And whenever it’s pointed out that it’s better in X country, The standard response is “well, we are not X country“. There was a woman who was interviewed recently on the Joe Rogan podcast —and Joe Rogan isn’t usually considered a “conservative“, more of a right-libertarian—and she was mentioning that in Finland, the parental leave policy is pretty generous. Joe‘s response was “well, we’re not Finland, we’re America“, with a big smirk on his face. He went on to say that if a male employee of his ask for several weeks off because his wife had just had a baby he would think that was crazy. For a guy who takes all sorts of psychedelic drugs to try and “expand his mind“, he’s pretty ignorant and devoid of imagination. Plus, he is the one who was in a position of power.

This is the issue in the USA. Very few want to give back to support their fellow Americans. Most are worried about getting and keeping theirs. There is very little communal support.  Most can’t see that lifting the bottom 30% would benefit everyone. They just see how much you are taking from them to give to people who “don’t produce.”

The mindset is quite terrifying because as long as the upper-lower class can hold the lower class down, there will always be someone below them. It’s self perpetuating. Middle class does it to the lower class. Upper middle class to the middle class. 

“Whatever I can do to stay above or keep them down makes me feel good about myself”

It’s why people vote against their interests. Not to help themselves, but to hold those below them down, and this is why it is very hard to climb to a better class.

jtharp7,hjz9p8l,">I can't understand how you all accept this situation.

Because what you are seeing on reddit is not the reality of the situation for a lot of people.  I went to public university with $0 support from parents.  Over 4 years of college, I accrued $17k of student loans (pretty much entirely went towards rent), and the rest was covered by financial aid (no merit based scholarships, just need based).  I did not work during college.  I then did a masters at a different public university and took out another 20K of loans.  Note: Most student loans in the US don't require payment until 6 months after you are out of school.  They also do not accrue interest in this time.

My first job came with 30 days paid time off a year (6 weeks!) and paid enough that I could pay off all of my loans in the first two years.  Not an engineer or programmer or anything special, just an entry level accounting job paying $55K a year.

Going to the doctor with a standard HMO health care plan that most people receive from their job costs $25.  $35 to see a specialist.  Emergency room visits are $150.   An ambulance ride is $100-200 on top of that if you need it.  I've been able to get this plan at 3 different employers and it is the plan that results in the lowest deduction from my paycheck.  This plan comes with an out of pocket MAXIMUM i can pay each year of $3,000.

Our system has so many flaws, but for the average person working in America it actually works out pretty damn well, and we pay much lower taxes.",1,"As a French, I can't understand how you people can even survive",SamDSx,/r/antiwork/comments/qq7f0e/as_a_french_i_cant_understand_how_you_people_can/hjz9p8l/,0.064,0.053,0.883,0.5349

growingitallaway,hjz78cr,"There's a section titled ""Education and the Fate of Youth"" on page 25 (numbered 37), where he starts to pull together the threads of the ""what to do about the kids these days"" problem.

>Young men and women were expected to leave home at a fairly early age—if not by nine, then certainly by their early teens—and spend the next ten or fifteen years in “service”—which basically meant,  as wage-laborers living under  the  roof of their employers. Rural youths, for instance, were usually hired at local fairs and worked for a year’s term before receiving their wages. Others were placed by their parents, though most often with masters whose social position was somewhat higher than their own:  a husbandman’s son in the family of a yeoman,  a yeoman’s daughter as a maid for a minor member of the local gentry, and so on (Laslett 1972,  1977,  1983; Wall  1983; Kussmaul  1981).
>
>This condition was expected to last until the age of twenty-five or even thirty:  in  part,  because  no  one  was  expected  to  marry  until  they had  ac­cumulated  enough  resources  to  set  up  an  independent  household  of their own. Wage-labor, in other words, was basically a life-cycle phenomena, and “youth,”  or adolescence,  the  period  during which one  accumulated the  re­sources to establish oneself as a fully mature, autonomous being. It was also the period during which one learned  one’s future  trade.  Even farm service was,  in  effect,  a form of apprenticeship.26 Servants in  husbandry—no  less than dyer’s or draper’s apprentices,  or, for that matter, knight’s pages—were in training, and though the technical know-how one picked up in such cir­cumstances was undoubtedly distinguished, in the abstract, from more com­monplace  matters  of deportment  and  propriety,  in practice  the  process  of learning them was more or less the same.",2,"Can we talk about how ""moving out at 18"" culture + pressure perpetuate wage slavery and debt?",WantedANoveltyAcc,/r/antiwork/comments/qq4dof/can_we_talk_about_how_moving_out_at_18_culture/hjz78cr/,0.026,0.02,0.954,0.2195

Quite a bit actually, if you think about it.

>What does the role of CEO have to do with anarchism?

Reducing the stature of the richest scumbag on the planet to nothing more than a gold hoarding dragon? Hmm, lemme think about that one.

I'm starting to think you don't understand anarchism.

I'm absolutely for taxing gains on company earnings and salaries, but that has nothing to do with trading. Company earnings need to be taxed before they hit the stock market, not after. If you start taxing after, you're predatory and it's the equivalent of leading a monkey to water and taking all of the water for yourself.",1,Elon admitting tax evasion.,Dark420Light,/r/antiwork/comments/qq7tib/elon_admitting_tax_evasion/hjytesb/,0.022,0.026,0.952,-0.1073
