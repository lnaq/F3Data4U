walter_midnight,hjy3x6z,"""stolen ideas""

By that virtue, all of the content the other channels make is stolen. What a dumb way to look at science communication, even if it isn't a full-length format going in-depth here and there.

Never mind that you too just blindly assumed that a channel you vaguely recognized is clickbait when one single look at his playliists could have told you that the titles are pretty much exactly the opposite.

How much more clear and descriptive do you need your videos to be than ""Making Smoke Crystals From Ammonia Gas and Hydrogen Chloride Gas""? If that were a cooking video, 90 % of the ingredients would be right there in the title.

Also, what a stupid way to approach the topic in general. Even if it was stolen ideas (which, again, is a truly dumb way of looking at goddamn fucking education of all things) and even if it was clickbait (which it demonstrably couldn't be further away from), there is still plenty of merit to teaching the abstract phenomena or realizations one might draw from this to people who can't keep up with NR, VE or any of the YouTubers who often require people to keep up with lots of information - and then some.

It is solid, by the way. You won't get your PhD using that material, but it does teach, and it does it fairly properly (never mind comparing it to existing educational infrastructure in many countries, lmao).

It is even worse when he has a video series about the same subject because he just says the same thing he said in the video before but in a slightly different way. I'm not sure why he does this, but his videos would be more concise if he didn't.

I would enjoy his videos more if he refrained from constantly remaking the same points without further clarification. Sometimes he even frames the comments as a question.

Most of his examples completely break down with any further thought. It's dumbed down to the degree of stupidity, and at that point you have people thinking about inane questions that aren't even relevant to the point he's making.

If you compare to 3Blue1Brown, the difference is astronomical. One puts immense production quality and thought into their explanations to make sure they not only make sense, but cover additional detail to give more context and the other wants to make everything sound AMAZING and INCREDIBLE regardless of if how he explains it even makes sense or not. You're completely wrong if you think you're gaining any valuable insight to physics by watching action lab, if anything it's so wrong at times that it teaches the wrong intuition or concepts.

Youtube videos tend to the former, for better or worse. There are definitely channels that do a much better job of explaining it in more context and detail, see Eugene Khutaronsky as an example. 3Blue1Brown is great for math, I say that as someone who studied math. It's not perfect obviously, but it doesn't blatantly lie to you or sell you something false. As an overview, it's a fantastic channel that does delve into details which provides a much more nuanced view. 

Veritasium and channels like his are simply to show off the concept as ""OmG COOL"" with any regard for what it actually is or means. I think he even mentions this. If you really think Veritasium is better than any University course, you're absolutely deluded, sorry. Even at an undergrad level, it's extremely hand-wavy and actually in many cases would give you the wrong intuition to follow. It's not density that makes something good, it's sticking to the conceptual idea of what you're talking about and how it works. Nuance is key here. It's very easy to state ""X is true"" as a fact like Veritasium and many channels do, but the issue is that statement can be blatantly false and have many exceptions. These exceptions are merely glanced over, or in many cases not even mentioned. It gives a completely wrong view into these topics. 

As a simple analogy: you learn physics in high school. It's watered down classical mechanics, but you cover it in detail. You have intuition for how classical mechanics works because you understand the framework, rather than some soundbyte. You're still off on how physics actually works, but you have a good intuition and base to work off of for actual Mechanics classes outside the classical reference frame. Now, in the case where you just listen to soundbytes with no nuance, you think you understand the intuition but now when you start to generalize up you draw false conclusions. This is the issue that these channels perpetuate. 

Do you think people watching those channels are as mindful of that as you are? I highly doubt it. Most people accept it as fact and move on and preach it somewhere else (I've dealt with this personally.). It makes people think they're experts because they watched a 20 minute video and can now explain quantum mechanics. I appreciate that you recognize analogies don't always work, but Veritasium isn't saying that, nor is Action Lab. They state their analogies as fact and move on which leads to viewers believing the same. 

Don't get me wrong, I totally watch youtube videos for understanding concepts on things I don't know, but I don't preach that they're good. I take them for what they're worth, a stupidly dumbed down summary of what 'may' be happening. Your last point is valid, but that's literally the same in this case. Veritasium and these other channels are on Patreon so you can support their work (a big LOL by itself) so they can produce more 'educational' content, but you could also just go to something like MIT OCW and find free material there that's at a much higher level of quality.",7,Neutron star experiment,0p88a,/r/rareinsults/comments/qq1n5t/neutron_star_experiment/hjykjz5/,0.125,0.045,0.83,0.9942

The one thing I do find funny with the younger people in this thread is the assumption that this artist (along with many others) will be forever remembered. There are so many current artists when you’re young that are lost to time. I remember thinking everything that was cool when I was a late teen/early 20s was peak culture…and a lot of those artists are now very niche. 

The turn tables will keep turning and they’ll have the moment when this same thing happens to them. I’m not saying this to be condescending.
