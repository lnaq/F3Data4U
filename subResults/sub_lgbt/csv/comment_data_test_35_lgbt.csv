BornVolcano,hjz1ddh,"Honestly, sibling works. When I went through a non-binary stage (just clarifying, non-binary is not a phase, but for me it was a step in my discovery that I was transmasc so I call it a stage) my brother would just refer to my by my name, or as his sibling. It sounds like it would be weird but it isn’t.

Instead of:    
“My brother likes cake. His favourite is chocolate.”

You just say:    
“My sibling likes cake. Their favourite is chocolate.”

It’s that simple. If people have a problem with it, that’s on them to deal with. And trust me, it’ll mean a lot to your sibling to do that.

Tbh it seemed very inclusive. I remember one kid made a snide comment about there being no gay kids at our school so it was a waste of time and our ultra-cis football coach health teacher got PISSED at sent him to the office, then told us there are gay people in all walks of life and certainly gay students at the school, even if they aren’t out. It seemed to be taken very seriously. And of course besides LGBT education we also learned about sex including different forms of birth control, laws surrounding statutory rape, consent, etc. We watched a video of a live birth which was fun and traumatizing to a lot of kids.

I know, and it's not that I don't. It's that I almost wish I weren't because I know how I'd be treated, let alone how difficult or expensive it would be to transition.

Typically I'd ask myself ""do I really want to (insert extremely validating feeling)?""
Nah! I'm ok with (thing I look like or do that just drains me.)

One commercial with two men kissing for like half a second, ""STOP PUSHING YOUR GAY AGENDA, STOP FLAUNTING IT IN MY FACE,"" but then cut to like seven commercials of hetero couples in each other's arms, making out, putting rings on each other, running down a beach in their wedding garb, sitting at a table with their kids, etc., suddenly it's chill.

I know it's a lose-lose game with those kind of people, because being openly gay is seen as pushing it in people's faces, but if you aren't open about it, and they learn that you are gay, then you're bad for hiding it and deceiving people. For some people, both acts can be seen as wrong enough to warrant physical violence.

I guess the only option they'd accept is to tell people you're gay once, but not immediately because that's wrong, but not too long after meeting someone because that's manipulative, and then never mention it again?

BlueMoon-Fox,hjwdlbk,"Gender ends up being complicated. We use the word to describe a socially constructed role that a person can participate in (Gender roles), but we also use the word to describe a way of seeing one's own identity(Gender identity), and we also use it to describe how one expresses themselves to other people through clothes, body language, personality, and other things(Gender expression)  

 So I don't think there is an easy answer for what gender is. It's basically a way to categorize how people are on a spectrum of masculine and feminine or neither.  It can be how you think of yourself and who you are. It can also describe how you present and interact with people.  Most people just the use the concept to put people in boxes so they ""know how to act"" in a social setting and to ""know their place in society"" and don't really think complexly about it or do anymore introspection. 

Being trans I've had to ask who am I and what does it mean to be a man or a woman or neither or both? I have yet to come up with simple answer beside people just are who they are. I identify as a trans woman, and living as a woman as brought me a sense of peace with myself that living as a man would never have given me. Not that I'm super feminine or anything. Just being able to express myself honestly and be really seen has really helped me. Aslo the hormones and surgery definitely helped with gender dysphoria but the feeling of rightness really came about when I could dress and act how I wanted and I wasn't trying to fit into a mold, but just simply be seen and respected for who I am a complex person who doesn't fit in a neat box. But that's just me personally. I think gender is simply a spectrum to describe people and a way of thinking about yourself.

pixie13903,hjvgo6b,">HE SAID that he wouldn't be friends with me if I were to come out as gay because he wouldn't understand how to keep a friendship like that. 

The friendship wouldn't change, at all. If he can't look at you the same way after coming out as gay then he's not a good friend in my opinion.

>I then asked him what he would do if he were to have a child and they were to come out as gay or trans

>HE SAID that he would disinherit them and then laughed 

Yeah no, your friend sucks and is a homophobe in my opinion. Saying he'd disinherit his own child after coming out as gay makes him homophobic in my eyes, plus wanting to end a friendship because they're gay also sounds homophobic to me.

Ending a friendship or disinheriting your kid because of their sexuality, something that has nothing to do with them and he's no affect on them, is a shitty thing to do.",8,I feel the pain of the LGBTQ community...,BirdMission,/r/lgbt/comments/qpiikx/i_feel_the_pain_of_the_lgbtq_community/hjvgo6b/,0.118,0.083,0.798,0.7658

Our parish is pretty progression since we're in a heavily democratic city, and our priest was investigated by the Vatican in the 80's for speaking about politics and can't become anything higher than what he is now. 

He did a homily in 2017 using that day's Gospel reading to bash Trump,[(you can read it and listen to it here)](https://www.stjames-cathedral.org/Pubs/Pastor/2017/17feb5.aspx?fbclid=IwAR0SE4c1CReEYyWR8CFxGZLPKEK13oKsfWtnZsONPkPJ2rA_hmL9d_fJtnc&fbclid=IwAR0SE4c1CReEYyWR8CFxGZLPKEK13oKsfWtnZsONPkPJ2rA_hmL9d_fJtnc) and it was the only time everyone applauded afterwards. He said that nobody could petition against gay marriage on church property when it was being voted for before it became legal nationwide and said that it would hurt people in our community.

JadedElk,hjuh2eh,"Sexuality is about attraction, not action. Someone can be entirely celibate, but still find people attractive and want to be with them. Others are sexually active with people but don't feel attraction to anyone. A gay man doesn't become straight because he has sex with a woman, why would kissing a boy make you gay?

StormTAG,hjv7wp2,"Hey man, I know you *know* but as a heterosexual man, there's still plenty of us out there that would accept you for who you are, no matter how you change and grow.

This community is for and mostly of folks who are LGBT, so I don't pipe up that often. However, I feel like I need to pop in here and remind you that not everyone is like your friend. Your friend has some growing of his own to do and maybe he'll even do that.

I'm not *defending* him, but social demonization of LGBT is a systemic problem. I'd bet large sums of money that his church and family have indoctrinated him that what he said is the ""right thing to say"" and he's never even considered the cruelty in his words. Perhaps your question might start the gears turning and maybe he starts to question that position. 

Don't assume it and don't make it your responsibility, but everyone who is taught that ""homosexuality is sin"" can eventually be taught otherwise. Most *won't* and the more important effort is to ensure that they are not allowed to *hurt* those they are prejudiced against. Yet, everyone of these folks who eventually figured out that their beliefs are founded on cruelty and tribalism and then overcame that indoctrination did so after being exposed to the wider world and realizing their mistakes. You may well have started your friend on that journey, or provided them another step along the path.

If you start to explore your own sexuality, you may find that heterosexuality and cisgenderism fits you. If it does, then you can join those of us who are allies simply because we feel that empathic support is more important that cruel tribalism. If it doesn't, then you can rest assured that there will be plenty of people who understand your journey in a way that I never will, and that there will be people like me that support you.

roxifer,hjulvw7,"I would say it is definitely a good idea to explore who you are and what does and doesn't float your boat in a partner. I'm 31 now and it took me until i was in my mid 20s to realise I'm actually bisexual. Just because you didn't come out in your teens, doesn't mean you never can/will. 

And I hate to say this as he's a childhood friend, but if he is that shallow and bigoted of a person, you should probably cut ties with him regardless of your sexual identity; people who propagate that narrative of his are part of the whole reason we still have pride. No, still *need* pride. Until people don't have to worry about family or longtime friends disowning them for being honest about who they are; until people aren't afraid to be as open about their relationship as straight couples for fear of being harassed, attacked or murdered, we need pride. And if your friend wouldn't be willing to accept you as you are, however you identify, then he isn't your friend to begin with. Friendship doesn't (or shouldn't) come with conditions - beyond the expectation to be treated fairly and with respect - and if there ARE conditions, such as ""we can only be friends if you are straight,"" then much as it might hurt, that isn't the sort of person you want to have around in general, let alone while you're exploring who you are and might want someone you can confide in.

That sort of strategy is way less likely to work on someone born here or someone who’s been here a long time, because a lot of people who maintain their homophobia like that have built up sort of an immunity.

Hardinyoung,hjy7se0,"If he’s 22 and you’ve been friends since the age of 5 either you were in Columbia as a younger person or he’s been in your country for 17 years. Either way, you’ve become aware of the fact that bigotry is not a label you’re gonna wear, regardless of your own orientation, so he’s at least been in an environment where he could have opened his mind as well. Still people mature and form opinions and grow at different rates. I’ve read the male brain doesn’t even fully develop until like age 25. I think if your friendship is going to end over this issue, you should at least really discuss these things with him and see if he might be capable of learning empathy towards others.  You may lose him as a friend but you’ve already decided that’s o.k because you don’t want to be exposed to his toxicity if he’s incapable of changing his mind. Or you may find that the discussion of this will draw you closer and be even better friends, regardless of whether you bring your own orientation up.
