chrisjfinlay,hikjsrj,"Well I’m gonna twist your melon some more, and give you a French press tip you never even thought of.

Don’t plunge it.

Trust me - it sounds crazy, but bear with me.

Put in your coffee grounds, add the water, give it a little stir, and put the lid on. Wait a min or two, and then spoon some of the “scum” off the top. After that, replace the lid and wait some more, 5 mins or so. Then gently press the filter so it’s just resting on top of the liquid, and very gently pour. You’ll get almost no grounds or silt in your cup. Plunging kicks up so much settled grounds that you always wind up with some in the cup. This way avoids it.

vectorYee,hiimumr,"I'm not a woman but a man. My best bud and I were out drinking. We were out cause he was going through some stuff. We are in a kinda downtown like aria, kinda city like.

We leave the bar and walk around a bit. You know, explore. We see this kinda cute goth looking girl sitting by a store front smoking. I have the idea of having him hit it up with her. He seems hesitant but walks up to her like a champ. I sit by the bench and start watching vids on my phone. Suddenly she starts yelling and a hole mess of other women come out. I run up to him to see if I could assess and calm the situation. Before I could say anything. I very large mammoth of a MAN comes out with a baseball bat. ""Don't you ever bother her again!"" He says. As the other women scurry inside of the shop with goth chick. 

After we leave that sobering experience. He only told her, hay and asked for a smoke. She was very nervous to be there. And he went for a handshake and noticed some bruises. He approached her to ask of she was ok. That is when the shit hit the fan.

Like 2 years pass and my other friend. She works as a social worker for kids or something. We tell her the crazy story. She asked were exactly it was. Turns out it was a house for battered women. Like an underground railroad for woman and children. 

We were fucking idiots and we learned real quick.

thesoulofasage,hik33f7,"This will probably get lost in this thread but here goes.  

Worked at a gas station for a few years during my late teens.  There was this creep that frequently came in, and always asked to take me on a date.  I always turned him down—I was in a relationship at the time and even if I wasn’t, he just wasn’t my type.  I’m also positive he had mental issues so although I was generally nice to him, I still maintained my sternness.  After all, he was a stranger and this is a business.  Anyways, he comes in one night to get gas, and doesn’t want to pay first.  I’m aware that some gas stations will let you pump first and THEN pay, but not the one I worked for.  He gets extremely irate when I refuse to turn the pump on for him, so he storms into the gas station, and cusses at me profusely for not turning the pump on, calling me all kinds of nasty things.  I reiterated that we cannot just turn the pump on for him, and that he has to pay first.  This is when he pulls a $20 bill out, throws it towards my face, and calls me a b*tch.  It floated to the ground, and that’s when I let him have it. I threw his money back at him, told him to get the f*ck out of the store, and never come back.  

Wanna know what he does when he picks the $20 back up?  He slams his hand on the counter with the $20 on his hand and says, “can I get your number?  Just write it on the $20.”  

Needless to say, I didn’t write my number on the $20 bill.  And it’s unacceptable to cuss someone out then ask them for their number.  

He also threw the gas pump on the ground outside and threw a match near it.  THANKFULLY, nothing sparked, but my boss had to get the police involved for attempted arson and it was a mess. 

Sorry this was such a specific reply—I just know there’s a lot of people out there who believe being as*holes to the person their crushing on is a good tactic to getting a date with them.

I was successful in getting a lot of dates from girls even from just brief interactions.

First asking a girl that barely knows you for personal information can be creepy where as giving a girl your number gives them all the power.

Second they are much less likely to feel harassed because they have the choice to never call/text you.

Third, in my experience, almost all the girls that do text/call you back are interested in you to some degree otherwise they wouldn't call you. Getting a girls number who has no interest is a waste of both of your time.

There was a nice-looking lady just trying to get through the self checkout song and dance, minding her own business and there was a guy next to her kind of doing the same thing, but he was watching her waaaay more than doing his own thing.

Anyway, there's a touchscreen and it prompts you to enter your phone number for 'loyalty' discount card blah, blah... This guy watched her input her number into that and then said 'hey, is that your cell number?' 

The lady, understandably, didn't know what to say. She just kind of stared at him blankly, to which he replied 'mind if I call you sometime?' 

I immediately felt the weird tension in the air and was about to do the 'Hey <totally made-up name>! I thought that was you! How are you doing' thing to get her out of the situation. I didn't need to, though. Once she realized what was happening her eyes turned into something like daggers and she quickly replied 'No,' lifted her phone and took his photo, as if to say 'you try anything Creeper, and the world will know it was you'.

PurrPrinThom,hik19tw,"I had a guy follow me home from a bar once and luckily I was enough ahead of him that I got through the security door of my dorm and closed it behind me.

When he got to the door he asked if I was going to let him in and when I said no he started yelling at me and calling me a tease and shit.

I never talked to him or interacted with him in any way. I don't  even know if he was in the same bar I was in or if he just started following me on the street. One of the scariest moments of my life. I don't have any idea what he was thinking. 

And as a sidenote: in retrospect I know it was stupid to go home and not go to a store or something because it let him know where I lived. But at the time, I wasn't sure if he was following me, because my university was in the downtown of a major city, and the route home only took major streets, so they tended to be fairly busy, even at 2am. There were apartment buildings, and student housing all around and I didn't want to assume he was being a creep if he was just another student walking back to the dorms, or someone who lived nearby, who needed to get to a particular transit line etc.",22,"Women of Reddit, where are horrible places for guys to ask for your number?",jrow21,/r/AskReddit/comments/qiaelk/women_of_reddit_where_are_horrible_places_for/hik19tw/,0.016,0.047,0.937,-0.6884

I feel that sometimes society makes me feel uncomfortable eventhough I'm the most innocent dude around.

phoenix_spirit,hijsu2s,"I'm glad you looked after that woman and made sure she was safe.
Women can't tell that you're the most innocent dude in the world just by looking at you. A lot of women have made that assumption with people they trusted and have gotten hurt or assaulted and you're a complete stranger. If we trust the wrong person, we also get blamed for not knowing better so it kind of sucks on all sides.
As for the walking behind a woman, I've seen some guys say that they announce their presence sometimes give their name and say they're just trying to get past her and women were both OK with and liked the idea. 
In those situations that you don't know what to do - like the walking behind a woman at night - ask women what you could/should do. They're going to know best what you can do and what you should not do when it comes to feeling safe and give you a better idea of what the best course of action in those uncomfortable situations.",55,"Women of Reddit, where are horrible places for guys to ask for your number?",jrow21,/r/AskReddit/comments/qiaelk/women_of_reddit_where_are_horrible_places_for/hijsu2s/,0.187,0.095,0.718,0.9608

QueasyConnection6321,hii11ta,"Any story where the villain was defeated at the last moment by the hero pulling some deus ex machina out of their ass, or trying some desperate million-to-one chance. Particularly where the villain has been shown to be intelligent, competent, not prone to emotional outbursts, and smart enough to have multiple backup plans. It's rather annoying when the author then proceeds to hand them the idiot ball purely so that the hero can win a fight they should never even have been able to make it to in the first place.

Interestingly enough, I don't actually put the destruction of the first Death Star in Star Wars into this category. The Rebels found a weakness, based an attack plan on it, followed it, and even if Luke hadn't been there with a skillset very well suited to the plan, any other Rebel pilot might have been able to make the shot.

xSTSxZerglingOne,hijk9f0,"So he paused. And The Grinch put his hand to his ear.

And he did hear a sound rising over the snow.

It started in low. Then it started to grow...

But the sound wasn't sad!

Why this sound sounded *angry*.

It couldn't be so!

But it was angry, so angry.

Every who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,

Whipped out their who-shooters and started to brawl.

Up top of Mt. Crumpet, The Grinch stared in awe

At the bloodbath in Whoville that now dropped his jaw.

But suddenly, Cindy-Lou Who shouted ""**STOP**!

I know who did this, he's on the hilltop.""

And the residents of Whoville just stared at the mountain

They gathered their numbers 'round Whoville's town fountain

They gathered their pitchforks.

They gathered their torches.

They gathered their sinister sharpened who-knortches

They marched up Mt. Crumpet with hate in their eyes

The mayor decreed ""Today, The Grinch dies.""

The Grinch saw the mob and he started to cower

He never knew Whos had developed such power.

As a last ditch effort he slid them his sleigh.

If he returned it they might go away.

Renewed with a fervor of righteous indignance

The residents of Whoville would deliver comeuppance.

The mayor took aim, Grinch's asshole did pucker

""The dead won't come back, Fabu Forres motherfucker.""

- he's wise enough acknowledge an order to the universe, but his ego puts himself above it. laws for everyone, but not for him even though he's the hero to his own story. 
- he leads, aids, and abets killers and thieves. even if he's a 'good' thief, he's an accomplice to worse people
- he actively and deliberately shot at cops. its all fair if you say 'fine rob a bank don't hurt anyone'... he came with guns and intent to kill if needed.
- he's a psycopath, even though he's almost redeemed at the end through his relationship he throws it away. the only emotion that ultimately leads to his downfall is anger and revenge, his ego is paramount.

gingerattack620,hiji3xz,"> he's the closest thing to a true villain in the story.

I was literally about to respond by disagreeing with this by pointing out that Dennis Nedry was more of a villain but I'm second-guessing that now. Nedry is directly responsible for sabotaging the island's computer system and thus turning off security measures which allowed the dinosaurs to escape. If he hadn't done that then Grant and the others would've just rolled back to the visitor's center and waited out the storm to try taking the tour again the next day, instead they had to deal with a T-rex and velociraptors.

However Nedry only did that since he was a disgruntled employee and was given an offer by one of Hammond's competitor's to commit corporate espionage. Hammond seemed to boast about ""sparing no expense"" for everything except the I.T. guy who frequently voiced his concerns about compensation and told him to just suck it up. It's tough to say that Nedry would remain a loyal employee though, even if Hammond gave him a raise and paid him $100,000 a year that doesn't mean that Nedry wouldn't take Dodson's offer if it was $100,001 per year and a nice hat.

Thematically Hammond is definitely the villain in both the film and the book, in the film it's definitely easier to put some of the blame directly on Nedry since he was directly responsible for the actions that led to people's deaths.",185,What villain deserved to win?,UnwantedJason,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi84yw/what_villain_deserved_to_win/hiji3xz/,0.134,0.081,0.785,0.9415

On Krypton, with the red sun, no one has issues with kyptonite obviously, because they LIVE ON IT. Why not? 

The way I always thought of it is kryptonite actually interacts with the stored yellow sun power in Kryptonians and makes it unstable. So if Superman had no powers, kryptonite wouldn't really effect him. But the more powerful he becomes from earth's sun the more dangerous kryptonite is to him.

**Edit:** The comics of course never state this, and have differing explanations that actually conflict with each other. Sometimes Kryptonite is created by the explosion of Krypton, sometimes kryptonite is what caused the explosion, sometimes kryptonite has always been on Krypton and is used to power all their devices.

The lawyer is the worst villain in the early going and he's not even that bad, just kind of a jerk. You don't have a good grasp on where the danger is coming from because of this, IMO, and it helps to facilitate the sense of wonder/awe because the plot is mostly ""look at these cool dinosaurs"" for a while; while also feeding a sense of foreboding because you don't know where the danger is coming from until Nedry's schemes are introduced.

It's ok if people guess the ending to a franchise that is 20+ years old.  They've had decades to try and figure it out. But the directors wouldn't allow it.",21,What villain deserved to win?,UnwantedJason,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi84yw/what_villain_deserved_to_win/hij9sci/,0.03,0.078,0.892,-0.5675

You see, Connery's character Captain Ramius isn't Russian, he's Lithuanian (the Vilnius Schoolmaster!). That 'otherness' is an integral part of the character, & part of Ryan's reasoning that he might be willing to defect.

All the Russians begin speaking Russian, then switch to English during the genius bible passage switch. From then all the crew speak English with a Russian accent. But if Ramius were to speak with a Lithuanian accent, that would be meaningless to English viewers - he would just sound like all the others.

The first part was supposed to be in Alachua County, Florida, which is basically the city of Gainesville, the home of the University of Florida.

TheToastyJ,hikitf3,"There’s apparently a word for it, but I don’t remember the word. But it can happen transiently as well. 

I know this well because it happens to me. I’m from the rural south and I have 3 distinct accents. 

1. Normal every day accent. Southern sounding but not over the top or unintelligent sounding. 
2. “Work” or “Professional” accent where I try to tone it down a bit. I know I don’t *have* to do it, but it’s something I’ve always done because I’ve been afraid I wouldn’t be taken seriously in the business world for my accent, because I work in Tech. Granted, I’ve been told I don’t do a great job of covering it up and then others have said I do so it may not be super consistent. 
3. When I’m with my family, especially my paternal extended family. I sound like a rural Appalachian hillbilly speaking some distinct dialect when I’m around them. 

All of this is subconscious, other than when I started doing #2 I don’t really do it intentionally. It just kinda happens depending on the company I’m in. 

This isn’t exactly the same thing that I think happened to Wanda, but it’s demonstrative of the brain’s ability to adapt something like an accent depending on the environment one may find themselves in.

Edit: Diglossia I think is the word.

Edit 2: I think my “natural” accent is #3. I think through various factors that have caused augmentation of how I talk, #1 became my every day accent.",8,What's the worst attempt at an accent you've ever heard in a movie or TV show?,bungeeman,/r/AskReddit/comments/qigvfk/whats_the_worst_attempt_at_an_accent_youve_ever/hikitf3/,0.084,0.044,0.873,0.9033

Fast forward to today, one nephew is a pretty solid kid, good in school and helps my mom around the house, but the younger nephew is a very entitled, inconsiderate teenage boy. He refuses to take care of himself and has his sick grandma wait on him hand and foot at times, and begs for expensive electronics until he gets them.

He also doesn't eat anything besides hotdogs and KFC chicken + junk food to the point that whenever we have home family events or just the usual eating in fancy places as a family, they would have to bring a packed lunch or order from KFC somewhere, because they never said no to him demanding for these food since he was younger. 

And one last thing, whenever he demands for something and it doesn't get accomplished right away, he starts hitting his mom or dad on the head. It gets pretty awkward when our family gets together because that's simply not a thing that anyone else in the family ever experienced.

Jak_n_Dax,hij1xmr,"Yup.

Of everything I learned in college, organization was one of the biggest life skills.

In high school school they just walk you through, you’ve got a set day with bells ringing to tell you to move along to the next class. Then you go home and do your homework for that day, with maybe one ongoing project that you have to track.

In college you set your own schedule, you’ve got to make sure you show up to the classes you picked on different days/times. Then you have to study on your own and keep up with homework. And you have projects that are sometimes months out that you have to track, etc. Throw in a part time job and it becomes total chaos.

I almost dropped out my first year of college due to the lack of a set structure. It was a huge shock. And I think a lot of people go through this as well, and it’s a big contributor to first-year dropouts. 101 classes aren’t harder than high school classes, but creating the structure to adhere to them can be.

I never had road rage until I got cancer. Even then, it's usually only going home from work or a long day out.

Most of the time, I remember that there are people in each car, and each one wants to get somewhere, and we'll all make it eventually. I even use Waze so I know what time to expect to be home; it takes the often false ""I could be there by now"" narrative out of my head.

But when I'm exhausted and sick at the end of a long day, I get tunnel vision. I need home and edibles and rest and a bathroom, dammit! There's a nonzero chance that I will cry and/or expel bodily waste before I get home, and I need to make that not happen.

That being said - my kids get a lot of what they want in life so long as I am in a financial position to do so.

They dont have daily chores but they have learned to help without complaint when asked because thats far better (in their minds) than daily chores. They all know how to do their laundry (youngest is 9) and the older two know how to cook (15 and 12). They are also expected to do their best at school. We dont expect all A's, expect the best they can do. Getting a C even though you tried your hardest (and the work shows that) and getting a C because you have 27 missing assignments are not the same thing.

KatAndAlly,hijamxt,"if I could do it again I would never have kids in the United States. There is no culture and no infrastructure to support a family unit.

And I think the biggest issue with that then is that both parents *have* to work full time but it is *never, ever the best thing for the household to have both of adults out of it for 80 hours a week.* 

*And I'm not some religious ""women should stay at home"" nutjob. In fact I'm a lefty feminist. 

I think two full time jobs when trying to raise kids is complete b******* .

I think everyone suffers in such families, but we don't want to admit it because it's heartbreaking and because we don't have a choice. 

When I hear from people ""it's fine, we're doing it,"" ""we love our jobs"" ""i don't want to be dependent on my spouse"", well they are lacking something *always.* 

Both or one is overweight because who the hell has the time to cook healthy food or workout?

or one of their careers is suffering because they have to call out due to child's sickness 

Their home is NOT a sanctuary to them or is not the investment it should be because who wants to spend the weekend cleaning and doing repairs/upkeep when you just spent 80 hours working and another 20 working your second shift (home, childcare after 6p).

Or the kids aren't ""alright""... so many people are *astounded* when their teenager gets in trouble for something between the hours of 3 and 6. Because the teenager's been hiding something:  drugs or oops they got knocked up or etc, because they're free during those hours

Or kids education is suffering because no one wants to come home at 6 and do long division with a grumpy kid, and things just slide, slide, slide and then the kid wants to go to college but no scholarship wants to give you money if you're a three-point student 

Or the marriage sucks because you come home and resent the other person not taking their turn cooking or because you just want to sit at the couch at the end of the day and not have date night or you're too tired for sex because you have been going, going since 6am

I think a healthy society for raising kids would have to entail reduced working hours. I think the only workaround right now is one spouse backing off work and concentrating on the above things so that BOTH spouses actually GET THEIR NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS to do what they want instead of the ""second shift'",16,What's a common thing people do without realizing it's actually making their life harder?,tropicalzhu,/r/AskReddit/comments/qiaf1k/whats_a_common_thing_people_do_without_realizing/hijamxt/,0.067,0.123,0.809,-0.9816

Bingo! I'd rather wait at multiple traffic lights, spending 2 minutes at each light, than brake every 3 seconds in a packed freeway. In the end, freeway is faster, but that kind of driving takes so much mental toll! I'd glady waste those 10 minutes to get some peace of mind.

Edit: There are also roads that are fast but full of potholes. There are roads where the sun does not shine right. There are roads notorious for speed traps. If you are a local and drive to same places frequently, its worth ignoring the GPS and finding your own best route. (You should still check gps to find out accidents and road closures though.)

Edit 2: Arguably, driving on a known and memorized route is safer than driving on a new one and following GPS's every direction, because you have to pay attention to the device, and a lot of times make sudden last minute lane changes and turns.",4,What's a common thing people do without realizing it's actually making their life harder?,tropicalzhu,/r/AskReddit/comments/qiaf1k/whats_a_common_thing_people_do_without_realizing/hijrv4x/,0.103,0.096,0.801,0.3036

My dad took his own life just before I started 7th grade and she was one of the very first people I opened up to about it and she made sure I had someone to confide in, especially when I was having the same thoughts. When I needed someone, she was right there inviting me for a girls night so that I wouldn't be lonely. She was a true friend that drifted apart. 


When I found out about her passing it wrecked me. I wish I could've been there for her the way she was there for me. When I found this song it added a whole new level to the grief.

I've played guitar for years and have always enjoyed singing but would never ever do either in front of anyone because I'm shy af and don't think I'm very good even tho she has always been encouraging if she has ever heard me without my knowledge. 

Fast forward a few months and one day I felt particularly brave so I recorded me playing this song and sent it to her. Note, I closed all the windows in my flat and locked myself in the bathroom because it has no windows haha. 

Anyway, she immediately called me in tears because she knew how hard it was for me to do that for her and now she says it's her favourite possession.

MentORPHEUS,hijwi2j,"The song, ""Hello, ma baby!"" made famous by Michigan J. Frog in the cartoon, was written in 1899 and is notably the first song ever about a man falling in love with a woman he has never met through technology, having only ever heard her voice through the telephone.

The word ""hello"" was mainly associated with telephone usage at the time, only becoming a generalized greeting more than a decade later.   Early telephones probably involved shouting ""Hello?"" a bunch of times before a conversation could begin.

The song was also a then-popular genre known as ""coon songs"" which were a craze from the mid-1880s, sometimes selling millions of copies and making white and black composers and performers alike rich.  The genre faded after the turn of the century as attitudes toward racism shifted.

It's still popular, but outside the verse made popular by the frog, the entire song isn't exactly a toe tapper.",2,What 100+ year old song is still a banger?,Nupps3,/r/AskReddit/comments/qig8gq/what_100_year_old_song_is_still_a_banger/hijwi2j/,0.077,0.032,0.891,0.8147

In Ukraine on night before Christmas people have a tradition very similar to trick or treating - Shchedryk (name of the song) when they wear unusual costumes (including one person dresses as a goat) and go in groups from house to house caroling and wishing all the well to those who open the door. And people give them treats (sweets, alcohol, sometimes just money, meats and fruits). There are other songs they sing but this one is the most important.

Clawsonflakes,hii5b02,"My favorite detail in that entire scene is when Baldrick tells Blackadder his plan, and Blackadder thinks for a short moment before saying “well I’m afraid it’ll have to wait,” and if you look at Darling he closes his eyes and hangs his head with this pained expression. The dude who always did his best to catch Blackadder in his schemes realizing that even he wouldn’t be able to save them now, it hits hard.

That, and the fact that Blackadder probably knew why Darling was joining the attack and that it likely wasn’t willingly, but he still gave him that last dignity of presuming he *wanted* to be present at the end. Similarly - the fact that Darling likely could’ve gone over the top anywhere across the line, but he chose to do so with Blackadder, George, and Baldrick.

So good.

keji_goto,hihzv6g,"The thing that really got me with Tadashi's death was just how senseless it was in the grand scheme.

Right before his death we see Krei meet with Hiro and try to recruit him. Upon failing to do so, especially with Callaghan's support, Krei tries to simply walk off with one of Hiro's bots. Why? To study and steal the idea. It was a underhanded as hell move that Tadashi saw straight through and got him to give the bot back.

Then there's Callaghan. Upon seeing what the bots could do and knowing he was going to mentor Hiro and oversee his project to its fullest potential decided to burn the entire place down, fake his death, and steal all of Hiro's work. He still had to spend months in hiding creating more bots and putting his plan in motion so it's not like he turned around going straight after Krei so he wouldn't get away.

Callaghan could have taken his time and stolen the idea right out from under Hiro's nose. He would have had access to everything and working directly with Hiro. The man is more than smart enough to do so and the guy who was willing to do anything to get rich and fast was going to go the slow route of reverse engineering Hiro's bots. Callaghan wouldn't have had to reverse engineer anything because Hiro's work would be right there for him to study, steal, and improve.

Callaghan was right when he said shortcuts are costly and those who pay the heaviest price are never the ones who chose to take the shortcut...

Furaskjoldr,hiio8cz,"The whole of the last episode is kind of like that. Pretty much every single character in it faces it in their own way. For Blackadder it's a panic to try and continually avoid the one thing he's done so well at avoiding so far, but eventually realises that it will catch up with him no matter how much he tries to escape. 

For George it's a case of his usual mindless optimism and encouragement, changed only slightly at the end when he realises that mindless optimism isn't going to get him through it anymore. 

Baldrick still tries his best to help, despite likely knowing he is completely powerless, as he is both incredibly stupid and also the lowest rank there. Even to the last though he is trying to help his officers get out. 

Darling is similar to Blackadder in the sense that he realises his endless evasion of death has finally caught up with him. Only he's resigned himself to this before he reaches the front, and once he is there only has pretty well placed pessimism. 

The last episode is so well done. It's such a change of tone compared to all of the others, and it really builds the desperation towards the end, until everyone has accepted their fate and the reality sets in.",82,What fictional character death hit you the hardest?,GoldenPhoenix21,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi39o4/what_fictional_character_death_hit_you_the_hardest/hiio8cz/,0.184,0.151,0.665,0.8507

ZippyDan,hii378m,">It just occurred to me that the ring must have tried to tempt Aragorn with power, like it does for everyone else.

Of course it did.

And in the movie, you can explictly hear the ring calling to Aragorn in the pivotal scene where he directly rejects its temptation for the final time.  Watch the scene just after Frodo escapes from Boromir and Aragorn finds him.  

After Frodo tells Aragorn that Boromir has been taken by the ring's power, Aragon asks angrily and worriedly ask ""where is the ring?""  You're meant to worry that Aragon wants the ring for himself, and maybe there is something of that, but he is also concerned that the ring might be lost.  Frodo then asks, ""would you destroy it?"" and he extends the ring towards Aragorn.  There is a moment of doubt and Aragorn reaches towards the ring, and that's where you can faintly hear it calling to him, ""Aragorn, Aragorn"".  Aragorn then closes Frodo's hand around the ring, pushes Frodo's hand back, and the temptation is passed.  Aragon then says, ""I would have gone with you 'till the end.  Into the very fires of Mordor.""",142,What fictional character death hit you the hardest?,GoldenPhoenix21,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi39o4/what_fictional_character_death_hit_you_the_hardest/hii378m/,0.069,0.09,0.841,-0.6818

Three theories : 

1) The simulation has a simple algorithm to keep an even spread of personalities.

2) Environmental epigenetic influences on zygotes. Eg cold dark winter months may effect certain cellular expressions (problem with hemispheres though)

You can claim Biden is dirty, but you can't seem to prove it.  Unlike Trump with his secret Chinese bank accounts and having all his debt tied up in Russia.  

Trump was impeached twice, but a Republican senate was never going to convict one of their own.  They don't have any honour, only party loyalty.  Everyone knew that was going to happen before it did.

Trump tried to leverage aid to a foreign nation, at war with an enemy of the USA, for his own benefit.  That's why he was impeached the first time.

Trump University - Shut down for fraud.
Trump's Charity - Again, shut down for fraud.  Trump was stealing from children with cancer and vets.  

Don't give me this 'Biden is dirty' bullshit, showing no evidence, while ignoring Trump's blatant criminality.

Troh-ahuay,hij8avk,"Louisiana was originally a nominal colonial holding of King Louis XIV—technically obtained back when England and France were vying for control over North America.  In practice, it was always largely controlled by Native Americans, and like most colonial holdings it was probably obtained illegally (even by European legal standards).  A [French explorer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/René-Robert_Cavelier,_Sieur_de_La_Salle) pulled a “[We have a flag](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uEx5G-GOS1k)” in 1682. 

In any case, after some shrinkage and shuffling of ownership, Napoleonic France regained the Louisiana Territory at a point when it stretched from roughly where Alberta and Manitoba are now down to the current State’s location—basically the entirety of the Mississippi River and its tributaries.

Shortly after regaining control, Napoleon ended up looking to unload the territory for some cash. Thomas Jefferson, then president of the United States, orchestrated [buying the entire thing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisiana_Purchase) without the authorization of Congress.  It has become an infamous, early example of the American executive branch pushing the envelope of its powers.

Jefferson arguably did not have constitutional authority to buy the territory on his own, but played the “better to ask forgiveness than permission” stratagem with emphatic success.

Vanilla_Neko,hiib7nq,"I honestly was a huge fan of the first Wreck-It Ralph movie and consider it to be honestly one of my favorite movies of all time so when I heard it was getting a sequel I was thrilled

My favorite movie was getting a sequel! Maybe it would be more adventures of Ralph and vanellope exploring this unique video game metaverse! Exploring new arcade cabinets may be brought into litwacks or something,

But nope instead they brought in a fucking internet router and it essentially became Disney's The emoji movie

A good majority of the runtime is Disney sucking their own cock off with a bunch of self-references mostly to forgotten princesses and characters that nobody really gave a shit about anymore unless you're one of those Disney obsessed people (like yeah people know about her but for example who honestly still gives a shit about say Cinderella or whatever)

They completely ruined all the character development from the first movie and boiled them down to bland stereotypes essentially turning their father-daughter relationship into Ralph being a borderline pedophile with severe attachment issues and vanellope being an edgy angsty teenager

It's literally such a recycled plot line that when I boil it down to what it is you've probably seen it a million times

- You don't understand dad you're too overbearing I need to go out in the world and explore on my own

- But I don't want to let you go because of blah blah blah and security

* Drama happens

- Okay sweetie I'll let you go off on your own

On top of that a ton of the runtime is dedicated to this weird montage of Ralph becoming internet famous it's boring as fuck and it mostly just involves the bottom halfs of poorly modeled humans pointing and laughing at shitty animations that are supposed to be Ralph recreating popular internet memes from like 2008

This movie is a complete mockery that ruined all the amazing character development world design and heart that the first movie had

SleepyFarts,hijgqdk,"A lot has been said about the lack of planning for the trilogy but I just want to bring up my main complaint with Last Jedi as a movie that exists on its own.  

First, the premise of the Resistance being chased by the First Order's capital ships through open space until their fuel runs out is one of the worst ideas I've ever seen from a sci-fi movie. Now, combine that with the fact that Rey has to get back to the fleet before losing contact with them, but she spends a large portion of her precious time training and arguing to bring Luke back.  There's never any real sense of urgency when they're together, like, hey, everybody I care about will be dead within a day, I'd better go into a trance a few times and learn to lift rocks. How do those two storylines fit together? I would have respected her character a lot more if she gave Luke a tough love speech and got the hell out of there, shaming him into coming out of his hermitage. 

And this is to say nothing about the terrible subplot of the tracking doohickey, which, if the creative team insisted on the fleet chase, should have absolutely been a spy storyline instead. We need a l33t hAxoR who can maybe possibly figure out how to break their tracking mechanism, so we need to travel to a planet we think they were at, where we don't end up finding the person in question. Then they end up getting betrayed anyway, but there are no consequences of that besides Brienne of Tarth dying like a scrub. It's a pointless waste of film, like the whole trilogy.",32,What's a movie you were super excited for but grossly overestimated?,JooseDoesThings,/r/AskReddit/comments/qibusi/whats_a_movie_you_were_super_excited_for_but/hijgqdk/,0.128,0.124,0.748,0.0467

But if they're too successful, then sometimes that means the executives notice and swoop in and micromanage it to death.  Sometimes in the form of making a live action remake.  Sometimes with a reboot.  And sometimes with more seasons after they chase out the people who knew what they were doing.

Like they didn't even matter to the story except for a very brief moment later in the movie where they helped out a bit during the real conflict of the movie if you can even call it that and frankly it really didn't have anything to do with them and could have easily been done with just generic new characters and still have the same impact

Like pretty much the only character development they got was briefly kind of becoming friends with vanellope over her being a princess even though very clearly in the first movie she rejects the idea of being a princess and instead technically becomes the first official Disney president as the President of the constitutional democracy of sugar Rush",4,What's a movie you were super excited for but grossly overestimated?,JooseDoesThings,/r/AskReddit/comments/qibusi/whats_a_movie_you_were_super_excited_for_but/hiiiogr/,0.136,0.049,0.815,0.9652

bruinhoo,hijczd9,"In hindsight, seeing how badly Eps. 8 and 9 were written and executed, sure. At the time of release, it was more complicated. 

In large parts of the fandom, there was a sense that Lucasfilm realized how badly they fucked up the prequels, and made Ep. 7 as a sort of palate cleanser to reset the franchise and set up the following films. Making the film a soft remake of the original was disappointing, but from that PoV, I could at least see why that storytelling decision was made. 

On release day, I left the theatre excited that 1) even if the plot was unimaginative, it was a solidly produced movie that didn't repeat the fundamental flaws that made eps. 1 and 2 borderline unwatchable; and 2) it introduced a compelling group of core characters who, I assumed, were set up to do fun/cool/compelling things in the following 2 movies. 

Considering the bad execution of ep.8 and the raging tire fire that is ep. 9, the legacy of this trilogy is that ep. 7 has to stand on its own, and can't be excused as the building block that it was likely planned to be. And once you see it as more of a stand-alone film, the warmed over plot and storytelling do it no favors.",1,What's a movie you were super excited for but grossly overestimated?,JooseDoesThings,/r/AskReddit/comments/qibusi/whats_a_movie_you_were_super_excited_for_but/hijczd9/,0.047,0.113,0.839,-0.951

1) Jar Jar

2) Sand

3) Noooo!

And things of that nature. Bad dialogue and goofy CGI and unmotivated character decisions.

While the sequels, well they look good, but similar issues with dialogue, character motivations, and tone. But most importantly ZERO DEPTH. The prequels had galactic politics but the sequels just erase the victory at end of Return of the Jedi.

Imagine if Leia and Luke had reformed the Galactic Senate and Jedi Order, and we got to actually see it. Then we get to *see* Kylo rebel against the order (no he doesn't have to murder everyone he meets to be the bad guy / anti-hero) and we get to see General Hux and his baaad terrorist *rebels* fight against a new government Leia is struggling to hold together, and we realize the situation is not as rosy or easy as we might have assumed.

Instead the film starts with(out!) a broken Luke Skywalker, a divorced, pathetic Han, and Leia's rebels are *still* on the run. Everything good about the original series is destroyed off-screen and we are given effectively a soft reboot film.

The protagonist, and basically all the characters, had the emotional awareness of a flower and the same level of emotional growth. It was amazing really.

They brought all three kids to Skywalker Ranch to do readings with Natalie Portman. One of the kids was Devon Michael and his reading with Portman is hands down the best of all the readings. The casting director and everyone thought hands down this is the kid. George wanted Jake Lloyd instead and despite some challenges from the casting director Lucas said it was Jake Llyod.

kityrel,hik2oz4,"I think the film was trying evoke something of Empire Strikes Back (Luke and Yoda is now Rey and Luke) (the asteroid field hide and seek is now a low speed chase) (the battle between Luke and Vader is now Kylo and projection Luke).

Problem is, it didn't make any sense.

How do you ""drop"" mines in space? Why can't the baddies just go to hyperspace *in front of* the fleeing rebels and cut them off? If **nothing** can track them through hyperspace, why does Leia have a ring that lets Rey track them through hyperspace? 

These plotholes make me immediately question the overall plot and the competence of the writers.

But there is also the question of how strong the force is. Kylo can talk to and see Rey across the depths of space? Luke can trick Kylo into believing a similar force projection is real? (Okay, this is new to Star Wars, but I can accept it, as it was executed fairly well.)

But then there are also the other ""choices"". Leia can fly now? (This would be fine if they **hinted** at it earlier, but this happens entirely out of the blue.) Captain Phasma *didn't* die horribly in a trash compactor on a crumbling planet? (Okay let's bring her back and immediately knock her in a firey pit!) Benicio Del Toro is in this film? (Why??) That guy just tasted the dirt, mmm, salty. ( Why? ) Luke just sucked on a blue monster tit? (Okay, Luke has gone full Yoda -- I can accept that...) Fin was a major protagonist in TFA but here he is the B or C plot? (Disgraceful!) What are Fin and Rose riding around on at the Casino? Why?? (Why?!??) Why won't purple lady just tell Poe what the plan is? (I am okay with leadership not explaining their decisions to all the underlings, but you're just setting up Holdo to be distrusted by the audience)

Worst of all, the Casino planet was a waste of time with no payoff for the characters or the plot. Rey didn't seem to really learn anything from Luke. Luke is back to his whiny ways with Yoda. Yoda is now a lightning throwing pyromaniac. You can now do hyperspace kamikazee into enemy ships... Rose nearly kills Fin with her ship to stop him from trying to save everyone's lives by sacrificing his life, BECAUSE OF **LOVE**?!?! And worst of all, at the end, the rebellion is reduced to a single ship yet everyone is still happy and smiling. What the hell.

The one thing that might have saved the film, but the producers were too cowardly to do it, is... after Kylo kills the big schmuck, he offers Rey his hand -- **she should have taken it**. It would have been a *mistake* on her part, but she should have made that mistake. Not because I think Rey and Kylo should be ""shipped"" (GROSS) but because that is the twist and the new direction these films needed. Imagine in the next film, Rey in charge of a Star Destroyer, trying to bring ""peace"" and order to the Galaxy, eliminating Hux's faction, negotiating a truce with Leia's rebels -- but things still going south because of further fractures in the empire, and because Kylo is still an untrustworthy little shit.

That would have been something.

Hell, The Force Awakens should have started with General Leia in charge of a ""Galactic Senate"" Star Destroyer.",5,What's a movie you were super excited for but grossly overestimated?,JooseDoesThings,/r/AskReddit/comments/qibusi/whats_a_movie_you_were_super_excited_for_but/hik2oz4/,0.094,0.157,0.749,-0.9921

Khudaal,hiiabbd,"To not be working a double on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day - or if I am, to have literally anyone say ‘Merry Christmas’ to me.

Christmas hasn’t been a holiday for me in six years. I’m on my own and in college, trying to scratch out enough of a living that I can afford tuition. The holiday season is usually a blinding mess of working as many shifts as I can because they pay better than usual - but I can’t afford to take off and actually enjoy the holiday with anyone. So I work the doubles, because I need to. The three weeks of winter break can earn me a whole $2000 if I get enough shifts. But the worst part about working the holiday is when folks come in and say things like “I can’t believe they have you working a holiday!” and then proceed to be one of the reasons why I need to work that day without saying something normal like “Merry Christmas!” as I prepare their food for them with the one other person in the restaurant.

Same goes for New Year’s Eve, Thanksgiving, Fourth of July, etc. I can’t afford to not work - but it’d be nice if while I was working, the customers treated me like a person who is maybe missing out on their holiday so the customer could be served instead of a very good dog, patting me on the head for not having a life on the holiday and then leaving a 5% tip after my coworkers and I kill ourselves to make their holiday enjoyable.",2,What do you want for Christmas?,Such-Fill-4681,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi4so3/what_do_you_want_for_christmas/hiiabbd/,0.157,0.057,0.786,0.9848

TrickyDaisy,hiian9g,"My heart is broken for you :(

If you are open to suggestions from a stranger on the internet....The first Christmas after my Grandpa died, my family changed a bunch of our usual traditions. I didn't think we would EVER change our Christmas routine...We had done the EXACT same thing--cooked the same foods on particular nights with specific family members at the designated locations--for my entire 30- year life. The year my gramps died, we changed up our routines, and it was exactly what we needed. Christmas felt different because it WAS different--but not JUST because he wasn't there. We made it different purposefully, and I felt like we were more in control of the atmosphere. It reminded me that the world keeps spinning, and there's space to be sad and miss the person you lost, but it's more about learning to live a new life with the person as a memory rather than continuing your same life with a missing piece. 

Good luck. I hope you find a way to balance missing your mom with enjoying the family you get to be with that day.",2,What do you want for Christmas?,Such-Fill-4681,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi4so3/what_do_you_want_for_christmas/hiian9g/,0.098,0.091,0.811,0.7543

Disc below the two they worked on has advanced and last two have pressure still on nerves and on the bones causing pain and swelling in the bone even.

brevicaudate,hijozg2,"if you want, here's a tradition that I just decided to start about six years ago. Every year, I spend a day making masses of these biscuits (https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/gingerbread-bunting). I cut them into stars, poke a little hole in one point of the star and then I use biscuit letter stamps to write things on them. I bake them, and then when I take them out, and they're cool enough to handle comfortably, I sit and use a needle to make loops of thread to hang them from. I then distribute to people (and keep some (lots) for our tree). The type of biscuits they are means they last for at least a month before going too stale, so you can just eat one off the tree whenever you feel like it! They make a christmas tree look really cozy and cute, and it's an ongoing snack! People seem to really like them because you can customise them so easily, so it's quite a personal present despite just being biscuits, but they're also kind of nice things to have around. I enjoy making them because it's pretty easy but is a great time to start feeling really christmassy! I put on christmas carols/radio comedy or whatever, and just have a day of actually feeling joyous and warm.

I’m not saying teamwork and positive thinking are bad at all, but if you’re going to try and get inspirational it’s actually better to stay AWAY from cliche quotes that you hear in movies and just use your own words lol

Edit: after reading everyone’s comments, I realized something: it’s not the quotes that make me mad, it’s when the person using them clearly doesn’t actually BELIEVE in them and is only saying them to cover up their toxic - ness.

Alive-Reaction-7266,hii0ter,"My father used to mock me with that phrase. 
I was diagnosed with PTSD and OCD this year. 😑

I knew I had OCD before I was diagnosed. 

At work, I'm the tidiest person going, at home everything is a mess (not dirty just untidy) but I know exactly where everything is. If someone moves something I absolutely fucking lose it. My anxiety goes through the roof. I hate the feeling of dread. Like, something is going to go wrong, I don't know what, but it fucking is, let me do shit my way or I'm gonna try scratching my skin off and smashing someone's face in. 

And it's like that all the time. Like, if I forget a step in a new recipe, that's it, it's all ruined (even when it's not). I'm just not gonna eat. Because I ruined it. 

And I get upset when other people do things the ""wrong"" way. My father has literally laughed at me and asked me if I was on the spectrum. 

And now I don't talk to him. He can go fuck himself. 

Anyone who pretends to have OCD should live a single day with it and then be asked if it's just about being clean or organised.",23,What is one phrase only annoying people say?,Loud_Conclusion_382,/r/AskReddit/comments/qhyxit/what_is_one_phrase_only_annoying_people_say/hii0ter/,0.08,0.201,0.719,-0.9862

ButtsPie,hiiwuuv,"I hear this kind of thing about ADHD sometimes, and surprisingly often with stuttering!

I don't want to diminish or dismiss people's struggles - one can have a hard time with these kinds of symptoms even if they don't have a full-fledged disorder. But it gets frustrating when they use their experiences to invalidate mine. 

For me this is especially hurtful in regards to stuttering. Non-ADHD people can have behaviours and feelings very similar to those caused by ADHD, just usually with a much lower severity and frequency; so even when people miss the mark, I feel like they at least understand part of my symptoms (I just have to make sure they understand the full scope of the condition). 

But in the clinical sense, stuttering is just a completely different phenomenon from what most people have experience with. It's like your throat and mouth are seizing and not letting you form sounds anymore. If you want an idea of what it internally feels like, think less ""nervous stumbling on words"" and more ""fighting against your body to suppress a bad cough"".",5,What is one phrase only annoying people say?,Loud_Conclusion_382,/r/AskReddit/comments/qhyxit/what_is_one_phrase_only_annoying_people_say/hiiwuuv/,0.073,0.176,0.751,-0.965

My wife hates she can't help when I get ""stuck"" in a loop because I can't remember if something is turned off or locked. My big thing is locks. I don't know why. I have to check that my kids are breathing in their sleep. I want to feel 4 big breaths on their stomach. If my brain says that second one didn't feel right. Guess what. We're gonna stand there for 10 minutes to be sure. Are their bedroom windows locked? Dunno it's one am but we're going to check... twice. If I miss one. 4 times. If I can't remember tugging at one window. We're going back and starting over. Did that one shimmy a bit? Oh God we've got to try again.

vix_aries,hiiokss,"Don't chase your ghosts. 

A lot of people never learn this lesson. Quite frankly I'm still one of them. It's important not to live in the past. The world keeps on spinning and the sun still shines on sad days. Appreciate the good times, but don't try to recreate them. They'll never be as you want them. Whether it's going after someone you lost or dwelling on a poor choice. Regret is like a drug, because we'd rather focus on what we could've done instead of what we can do in the now. 

It's hard not to let your past define you, I for one struggle with it a lot. Find the good in the present even if your life seems like shit. There is always something that could be worse, but isn't. Chasing your ghosts is a task without reward since you'll never catch them. Letting the dead things die is what's best for you and them. Don't forget them and don't regret them, but let them live in the past. When everything's all said and done you'll get to live there too. 

Until that point, fight for the good things.

I know that sounds awful, but seriously. You can get away with being flaky and noncommittal when you're college-aged because peoples' schedules are generally much more flexible, and getting together on the weekend doesn't require much more than a last-minute group text and a beer run. Once people start to have less free time (whether due to work, family obligations, kids, living further away, etc), not so much.

I know way too many people who made a habit of leaving invites on ""read"", flaking at the last minute, etc and now complain that their social circle has shrunk.

""if you're good at a shit job no one else wants to do, you will always be made to do that shit job"".

This is something i still struggle with because i tend to take a lot of pride into putting effort in the thing i do, but most people will never put in the effort you do or hold the standard you do. In fact, I guarantee you some of the people reading this, nodding and agreeing, think they're the hard working ones at work when in fact they're incredibly lazy or incompetent, but are propped up by group efforts like that slacker in your group project in high school. 

The thing is, as much as that slacker deserves a slap in the face, they're the ones doing it right. Unless its a passion project for you, or something for a loved one, you should NEVER give anyone 100% of your effort, because the truth of the matter is that most people in your life WILL NEVER GIVE 100% FOR YOU.

A few months later, a customer walked in who just happened to be one of my past college teachers. He said he knew someone higher up in my company and would put in a good word about me. I thanked him, not really thinking anything would come from it. But less than a year later, an opening happened in my teacher's friend's department.

LewisEFurr,hiizggv,"I recently had an interaction with a neighbor where, long story short, his entire house is covered wall to wall in beautifully framed horror movie posters and I'm a horror movie fan.  I was very excited to talk horror and he had the personality of a doornail and was clearly not interested in pursuing anything further.  Even my wife was shocked at how he was obviously giving me the cold shoulder.  That's cool man, you do you.

There was a time in my life when I would have wondered why, why wouldn't this person like me?  was it something I said or did?  how can I win them over?  or some other derivative of shit like that.

Now?  Your loss dude.  you live 3 houses away, we could have had movie nights, I have a huge collection of horror figures, this could have been the start of something beautiful.

I wish my husband helped out a little more frequently but I don't mind making the extra effort to keep things tidy (my only real gripe is his not putting dishes in the sink or dishwasher immediately, I'd like the sink to be clear by bedtime everyday but that's trivial). 

I like my job but hate being there all the time- 60 hr weeks for a few months with 2.5-3 hrs commute time a day and at least one sat a month.  The extra money is always useful but you can't buy the time back with it. 


Between our mutual exhaustion and busy schedules it's hard to make alone time (we also work opposite schedules). 

I wish my siblings could find a peaceful way to resolve their conflict.  I wish I didn't have to worry about my mom all the time. I wish I cared about my dad again enough to worry about him.  I wish I cared enough to keep more in touch with my extended family, I do miss them. 

I don't live as close to most of my friends anymore and that's fine, I check up on a number of them weekly. I spend a lot of spare time trying to stay in their orbits because I want them to know someone is always looking out for them.  But I miss the easier, harder, younger years when we were broke and figuring life out together. I miss having the time for them and with them even as I relish the quiet life at home. 

I miss not worrying about everything I ate.  I miss going out on dates (I pester the hub a lot on wanting to take him out). I really miss having more than 30 minutes to play videogames on the couch.  

But you know, I get home and he's there and out pup is there and just feeling his hand on my back or my leg for a minute and all that dwelling goes away.

Jakesworld,hih41mm,"The worst I've ever been. Fiancee left me, had to move homes back to parents, had to leave my job, she took all the pets that were dear to me. My whole life has basically been turned upsidedown. There's nothing I could have done differently apparently, no infidelity, no abuse, no gaslighting, reason for her leaving me was null, just that she wasn't feeling it anymore. 

Had months of severe depression and anxiety because of it, brought me to contemplate suicide and still think about it almost everyday. How can I improve as a person if I don't know what I do wrong? I had zero closure. 6 year relationship of living together and travelling together.

I have tried to seek help, I saw a GP who gave me a referral to a therapist clinic who when I called to schedule up an appointment I was told no availabilities until February/march next year.. I've tried other clinics and got a similar response. How can someone seek help if no help is available or responds? Then what? I guess suicide or close to it is the only way I can show that I needed help.

I live in a high cost of living state/city, and I make enough to be somewhat comfortable with the necessities, but not enough to really enjoy luxuries in life. I barely save money from my paychecks because they go right into rent, food, gas, daycare tuition, student loans, and car loans.

I found out that she fucked someone within 24 hours of breaking up, she's claimed to be so madly in love with me and I'm the only one for her, but how could she jump into bed with another man so soon? 

I'm in the process of getting a job that is close to where I'm living but I doubt I'll get the job. It's a gas station that only seems to hire anyone but white people. I had to give up tow trucking because my anxiety would spike and I couldn't ground myself during my attacks.

I've lost contact with both of my parents because of the years of abuse and them not seeing the err of their ways.

My life is a complete shit show and I've really contemplated un-aliving myself because I'm just about as useful as tits on a bull. I own not a single, discernable skill that could help me or others around me, in life.

Hell, I'm convinced that I have a severe mental condition that prevents me from completing daily tasks such as taking care of my personal hygiene.",3,At the end of the day... how are you actually doing?,Artist0491,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi1mcc/at_the_end_of_the_day_how_are_you_actually_doing/higoxki/,0.081,0.167,0.752,-0.9718

inkseep1,hih48k4,"I have been thinking about this question a lot recently.   

I used to base success on good grades.  Then when I got out of school there were no grades and no clean slate beginnings of semesters anymore.   

So success became scored by money.  But I didn't get into a super high paying field.  I got a job at a company where I could expect to work for life and now I am on my 25th year.  I will not get super rich but I won't starve, I get 39 paid holidays / vacation, great health plan, and there is a pension.   It is a nice gig that doesn't even feel like work anymore except for the time involved.  

And I always was doing a side hustle.  I have a side business and success is definitely based on making money over expenses and scoring a win on every trade.   And I started rehabbing houses into rentals.   Next week I close on another property that already has a tenant who does not know yet that the house has been sold.  This weekend I will build a custom door for a house I am rehabbing because I can't order one like what I want.  I get to go buy some new tools for that but it is less than the cost of someone else doing the door.  

Lately I have been thinking that all this work and running around is pointless.  I mainly want to be warm in the winter, cool in the summer, and have good food.   I could sell everything I own except my smallest house and I could live there without having to work anymore and still eat well.   But I don't know what I would do with my time.

I saw a homeless guy sleeping under a bridge while I was schlepping into work and I really thought that maybe he is doing better.  He is sleeping instead of working.  He doesn't have 8  bosses.  Gets free food and services.   Puts out his hand and enough people give him money.  I don't like camping enough to do it full time.     

I am planning on spending next summer building a 28 x 48 workshop on one of my properties.  I plan on doing all the work myself because I have the skills now to do it all.  I can even raise the roof trusses by myself.   Then I will build canoes.  I can't stop thinking about making canoes.  I don't even like the water but I will build canoes. 

Doing ok I guess but I keep running on this endless treadmill just to keep the treadmill going.",2,At the end of the day... how are you actually doing?,Artist0491,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi1mcc/at_the_end_of_the_day_how_are_you_actually_doing/hih48k4/,0.148,0.044,0.808,0.995

Cloverkeet,hih5zyx,"The fog is finally lifting, and I’ve been in a much better mental place for a few months now. 

I went on an impromptu trip to Hawaii (even though it was for a funeral) with family that care about me. The change of scenery and being surrounded by great people really helped pull me out of my funk.

I made the choice to permanently cut a toxic bully “friend” out of my life and blocked them on everything. Haven’t seen them in months and I couldn’t be happier. I also sort of made up with an ex-friend who’s been passive-aggressive with me for months, and we’ve actually been on *okay* terms for now. Feels good to be around her and not have her purposely ignore me in a group setting and treat me like shit. It’s at least a start.

I stopped self harming and although my suicidal thoughts still pop in to say hi sometimes, they’ve mostly left me alone. I got diagnosed with “trauma and stressor related disorders” and possibly PMDD.

I’m getting better at processing the deaths of my parents and the other trauma I went through. Therapy is absolutely helping with this. I’m learning more about my needs and how to treat myself better. I’m learning to listen to myself.

I escaped a financially and emotionally abusive situation. While I’m still salty that justice may never come to my abusers, I’m learning to move forward. I’m finally learning to have control over my own future as an adult. It’s nice to not be controlled by fear anymore.

Things are overall pretty great. Feels like the world around me has gained some of its color back. While I still have a lot of shortcomings and things to work on, I finally feel like I’m getting somewhere and that things are changing for the better.",2,At the end of the day... how are you actually doing?,Artist0491,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi1mcc/at_the_end_of_the_day_how_are_you_actually_doing/hih5zyx/,0.156,0.119,0.725,0.9184

relativelyfunkadelic,hiifjpw,"don't let that guilt eat away at you. every single human on earth makes mistakes every single day of their lives. the guilt is a good sign that you've learned from those mistakes, but you can't let it end there. you've gotten what you need from the guilt, so learn your lesson and drop it, leave it far, far behind you. cut off any thoughts that lead to that guilt and allow yourself to feel the happiness and joy you're deserving of, the good things that help us everyday which guilt keeps away from us. idk what time it is there, but it's 8:30 a.m. here which means there is an entire new day ahead, and that happens every single day. the most monumental, lifechanging things take place in front of us in the blink of an eye, so there is no telling how much adventure and excitement these next 24 hours hold. if it's nighttime there, it means you got a whole night of sleeping and dreaming to do before that adventure starts. i promise you, today is gonna be different from yesterday. always is. and that's the beauty of the whole world. don't hold on to stuff that took place in a different world, just look around and see how beautiful today's new world is. 

it's completely normal to feel like this, but i hope you know you really deserve to break free from what's tying you down and take on all the new experiences life has in store.",2,At the end of the day... how are you actually doing?,Artist0491,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi1mcc/at_the_end_of_the_day_how_are_you_actually_doing/hiifjpw/,0.191,0.08,0.73,0.9912

TheBertinator3000,hiiu07v,"That step is a skill in and of itself. Mindfulness can help, to some extent. So can setting aside time to ask yourself questions about what is bothering you.

I actually heard a really potent ""meditation"" technique (I don't know if this one technically qualifies or not?) for determining what the heart is concerned about.

Set a timer for 10 minutes, close your eyes, and just let thoughts come to you, uncontrolled. Don't try to let them pass, like you might in a traditional meditation. Just let the mind do whatever it wants. Just watch and listen to it. Like you might listen to a friend.

The first 5 minutes are probably gonna be a lot of random nonsense floating in and out of your head. But the 5 minutes after that?

I cant imagine how many phone calls people like lets say elon musk for example wakes up to. How many people are on his ass. Always bitching about something. Something is wrong and needs to be fixed. How quick something will fall apart without their presence, money and administration. You dont just make a billion dollars then disappear into the deep blue sea forever. A lot of it is invested in people, organizations, projects. If a billionaire just disappears, somehow, it will catch up with them. 

If i was rich, id fix up my Honda a bit. Get a decent house. Idk what to say about the hot girlfriend. Ive been with some attractive women who mightve been summoned from hell itself. Lol.

More than anything id like to just figure out what it is thatll make me feel whole and fulfilled in society and make a decent enough living to not have to worry about being homeless or starving.",3,At the end of the day... how are you actually doing?,Artist0491,/r/AskReddit/comments/qi1mcc/at_the_end_of_the_day_how_are_you_actually_doing/hihpehm/,0.129,0.114,0.757,0.4777

TripleSevenATX,hijxtyb,"Surprisingly, no. 

Did I for the first few months though. Yes. Absolutely hated being a parent, my partner ended up in the ICU from the experience, and the ""village"" we were supposed to have (which was one of my driving factors in saying ""yes), dried up with the pandemic. 

Yep. She was born Jan 2020. Welcome to the world, kid. 

We have, however, made it this far. Our kiddo is smart, funny, brave, and beginning to really be a little person, as opposed to a helpless potato with needs and no volume control. 

What I once hated, I've started to enjoy here and then. I'm still on antidepressants for the first time in my life, but I think that's mostly ""extrovert in a pandemic and actually isolating"" syndrome now. 

Would this be easier and more fun without a kid? Yes. We could choose our risk levels without an unvaxxed human in the house. We wouldn't have to miss LITERALLY EVERYTHING that will have strangers in it (or let's be real, ""friends"" who don't take it seriously too) for nearly 2 years now. 

One other caveat, I didn't do it just for her. I just finally came to terms with the fact that this is the most stable my life has ever been, I'm in general the happiest I've ever been, and if something happens to me, kiddo won't end up like I did. 

Orphanages suck, whatever the reason you're there.

ComposerBeautiful875,hik2h7d,"No, I don't. I didn't have one for my partner per se, but got pregnant surprisingly after he was told he was sterile after chemotherapy.  I had never wanted kids but he had always wanted more (he had a child from a previous relationship) and was thrilled that I was pregnant.  The worst part was that he died from cancer before our child was born, so he never got to meet her.  But I don't regret being a parent, even though I hadn't thought it was in the cards for me.  I've definitely grown as a person as a result and cherish having that part of my late partner still here, doing great things and being a great person.  She's a terrific part of life and I wouldn't change a thing.  But I definitely don't want any more children.  I'm definitely a 1 child parent.

He and our kid are two peas in a pod. She's two, and she talks about him non-stop. Everything is ""My daddy!"" this and ""My daddy!"" that. We're not together anymore, but I don't even mind that my daughter seems to prefer him over me because I never had a good relationship with my dad. I love how invested he is in her.

That being said, I do know people who regret being parents, so I don't recommend doing what my ex did. If you don't want kids enthusiastically, don't potentially ruin your own life and a child's.

insertcaffeine,hikihuz,"It took a lot of convincing for my ex-husband to talk me into having a kid (which is a huge red flag that I shouldn't have done it). He was so excited to be a dad and be involved with his kid and be a hands-on parent and all that.

Kid was born, I got postpartum depression that evolved into intractable major depression like a soul-eating pokemon, and Ex did no work around the house. He'd hold the baby while I cleaned. He'd change a onesie here and there. But if it wasn't fun for him, he wasn't doing it.

We divorced. (yay!) Kid got bigger and more fun, messes got smaller. (yay!) Kid started showing signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety, not being neurotypical, and being transgender. So. It's up to someone to research all that and hook Kid up with therapy. (surprise, it was me)

Now Son is 14, we're still working on his mental health, I have married Husband and he's good grown-up backup. Son's getting what he needs to transition, and things are cozy, right?

Nope. Just when things were getting manageable, I got metastatic breast cancer.

If I could just Ctrl-Z Son, I would. He doesn't deserve the shit he's gone through, and he definitely doesn't deserve the devastation of a parent dying when he's still a kid. (My dad died when I was 18. Like, take my parent and fuck my whole worldview while I'm at it, universe!)

SweatyExamination9,hih7qn1,"Red is one of the few TV dads that truly cares about his kids. Especially in that era. On TV, kids are viewed almost like an obstacle by dads, or they're just incompetent goofballs. Red had his moments that bordered on abuse, and he crossed the line at times. Like nailing Erics window shut. But he actually cared, not only about his own children, but all those around him. Red stepped up as a father figure for an entire group of kids with absent or otherwise unavailable fathers. When Jackie's father went to prison, it was Red she went to for comfort. When Hyde's mom skipped out of town, it was Red that took him in despite barely being able to afford to put food on the table for his family as it was. Fez's parents were in another country and his host parents were very inattentive, and Kelso's parents were as dumb as he was, but both saw Red as an authority figure in their life that they respected and wanted to impress. When they got an apartment together, they wanted Red and Kitty to come over and visit. They wanted approval from their kind of adoptive parents. 

A lot of people don't like Red because he was mean. But he was also very loving, and when Kitty calls him a big softy, this is what she's talking about. Despite his rough exterior, he's a genuinely kind and caring man. His character is extremely well written and incredibly under appreciated.",392,What is the best couple in tv history?,savegeAFcombacks,/r/AskReddit/comments/qhvzne/what_is_the_best_couple_in_tv_history/hih7qn1/,0.169,0.06,0.771,0.9869

underlander,higj54p,"This is 100% what the original show was about. The Addams are a healthy, loving, supportive family who often open their home to strangers, treat people from all communities equitably, and try to share their traditions, culture, and even money freely. Gomez and Morticia have a model marriage. The point of the show is that we don’t need to understand or be similar to other people to treat them with compassion and engage enthusiastically with their customs — to them, they live in a world of total weirdos and they just do their best to be kind and generous anyways. The fact that they have a loving and thriving marriage is just a reminder that people in different families can still have healthy relationships.

Hal keeps coming up last for personal and professional accomplishments until the table comes around to the question of marital sex livelihood. Everyone gives their answer and it comes around to Hal who meekly answers 2. He gets roundly mocked for only having sex twice a week at which point Hal realizes he misunderstood the question to be how many times per day while everyone else understood it to be per week.

I told him not to worry about it, and if he though about it too much it would never happen. Just go with the flow. He ended up dating that girl a few times, and while they never had set, he “broke the seal” with girls so to speak.

Acceptable-Mess8132,hijvry8,"Flying Foxes, and bats in general. Bit of a weird combo. Flying Foxes are fascinating to me because they look like puppies, eat like starving rats, and are incredibly social. They are also one of the few animals (depending on the flying fox species) that engage in sexual behaviour that isn't apparently related to having kids. Some biologists say that the oral sex they engage in is to increase fertility, but considering the fact that it's not always heterosexual... Seems a bit of a stretch. 

Most of them are polyamorous as a result, but there are select species that are monogamous and form long term pairs. 

I just like bats in general as they're all adorable (yes! Even vampire bats with the wrinkly little faces!) And do important work in the ecosystem, for us particularly, the other bat species can eat 10 times their bodyweight in bugs *every night*. Mosquitoes and moths mainly! 

They are also not blind! Some have quite good eyesight, though many of them do indeed have poor eyesight. They don't bite unless threatened, and can carry a lot of diseases so it's more important to stay clean if you get in contact, but the liklihood of a bat coming at you is fairly low depending on your location. 

Plus, how cool is it that there's a mammal that can fly?!",2,"Fuck deep philosophical questions, what's your favorite animal and why?",GIANT-GOAT-PEEN,/r/AskReddit/comments/qigxf1/fuck_deep_philosophical_questions_whats_your/hijvry8/,0.174,0.039,0.787,0.9863

rabbiskittles,hik6mzl,"Sharks. When I was young, I would fall asleep listening to a cassette tape of shark facts.

I love how sharks are just so optimized as ocean predators. They are *really fucking good* at what they do. Among many other awesome things about them:

-	Their teeth are not one and done like ours. They have rows upon rows of teeth that are constantly being replaced, like a butcher always sharpening their knives.
-	Their skin is literally covered in tiny sharp teeth/scales, like sandpaper, because obviously limiting teeth to just the mouth is an amateur move.
-	Most people know about their acute ability to smell blood, but they also have this whole extra sensory organ called the [Ampullae of Lorenzini](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ampullae_of_Lorenzini#Introduction) that lets them sense tiny fluctuations in temperature and electric fields. Among other things, this lets them find their prey by literally sensing the tiny electrical field produced by muscle contractions.
-	Like stingrays, they don’t have bones, because screw those breakable bits. Their skeletons are entirely made of cartilage.
-	[They cannot swim backwards AT ALL](https://animals.howstuffworks.com/fish/sharks/shark2.htm), because they aren’t some lame omni-directional hot air balloon. They are streamlined fighter planes, capable of extremely high speeds, sharp turns, and sudden stops.
-	Finally, for all this violence, they still form beautiful symbiotic relationships with remora fish, which has *literally evolved a suction cup on its head to cling tightly to their shark pals*. These remora get the best bodyguard one could ask for and all the leftover scraps from the absolute carnage of the shark’s meal. In exchange, they keep the shark’s belly free from parasites.",1,"Fuck deep philosophical questions, what's your favorite animal and why?",GIANT-GOAT-PEEN,/r/AskReddit/comments/qigxf1/fuck_deep_philosophical_questions_whats_your/hik6mzl/,0.129,0.046,0.824,0.9693

peon47,hikc3pb,"Elephants.

One big bull elephant was shot with a poison arrow by poachers, and sought out veterinarians at an elephant sanctuary for treatment. He was a 100% wild elephant, and had never visited that sanctuary before, though some of his mates/herd had been raised or treated there. Apparently, they had told him those were ""good"" humans who could help.

There are also caves in Africa where the rocks have a very high salt content. Elephants periodically stop there, enter the caves, scrape rocks and stones off the wall and eat the stones to add salt to their diet. The caves are 200 meters deep and pitch black, but they find their way in and out with no problems, despite having poor eyesight. How? Each time they go, they bring their young who learn the way in and out. But how did the first generation find their way in? Well, the first elephants to eat salt there only had to go a short distance. They've been going there so long, they've deepened the caves.",1,"Fuck deep philosophical questions, what's your favorite animal and why?",GIANT-GOAT-PEEN,/r/AskReddit/comments/qigxf1/fuck_deep_philosophical_questions_whats_your/hikc3pb/,0.071,0.021,0.908,0.8473

The mudskipper is a fish that lives a fair amount of its life out of water. That isn’t to say they go on dry land; they stay in the mud next to waves to have a constant supply of moisture. The mudskipper uses its pectoral fins to “walk”, but it’s more or less dragging itself across the land. The mudskipper can breathe air and is one of the marine animals that can drown if it stays in water for too long.

coder_tim,hieu689,"I remember seeing bumblebees everywhere when I was in elementary school (early 2000s). I grew up in the midwest suburbia, and I have fond memories of grabbing my butterfly net after school and pretending like I was the the butterfly equivalent of Steve Irwin. Yes, indeed, I fancied myself quite the garden naturalist and explorer. 

Neighbors would see me and my butterfly squad prancing through the neighborhood - bold little adventurers decked out in makeshift safari gear crouching, rolling, and patroling through the backyards - trying to scout out the very best butterfly garden hotspots. When we found a good garden, we would document it in our butterfly safari map. Then we’d revisit the butterfly oases as the season progressed to see how different flowers blooms impacted the bug turnout. We would catch all variety of bugs, put them in our bug zoo, and charge parents to see our haul. (Of course I would always release them - even if some of our zoo keeper fancied themselves as quite the taxidermists.) 

We’d ALWAYS be dissapointed (70% of the time irl, but it felt like always) when we’d show up to our butterfly hotspots and see nothing but buzzing, droning, mindless bumble bees. They would come in such numbers! I thought they were pushing all the butterflies away. It was such a let down when I wanted those beautiful butterflies. I am sad to say I would have welcomed their extinction at this point in my life.

Not anymore. Today, I understand their importance. Sadly, I cannot remember the last time I heard the buzz of a bumble bee float by, and I will be sure to take a mental snapshot next time I see one.

So I’m not sure light pollution is a big driver of the problem, I would be inclined to blame people turning their lawns into green wastelands.

Grass isn’t green! Bring nature back to your yard and enjoy the sights and sounds.

Edit: wow this really blew up, thanks everyone!
I should add that this is heavily dependent on where in STL you are, ironically the more desirable places are going to have significantly fewer because of the way people treat their lawns.

metzeng,hientkw,"""Well ya see, Norm, it’s like this… A herd of buffalo can only move as fast as the slowest buffalo. And when the herd is hunted, it is the slowest and weakest ones at the back that are killed first. This natural selection is good for the herd as a whole, because the general speed and health of the whole group keeps improving by the regular killing of the weakest members. In much the same way, the human brain can only operate as fast as the slowest brain cells. Excessive intake of alcohol, as we know, kills brain cells. But naturally it attacks the slowest and weakest brain cells first. In this way, regular consumption of beer eliminates the weaker brain cells, making the brain a faster and more efficient machine. That’s why you always feel smarter after a few beers.”

Bertolli_28,hifzr48,"I've tried to foster that sense in my own neighborhood, we do decently, but i think what I've noticed that kills the sense of community is

1: people not willing to actually leave their house, and

2: people moving too often. 

In the 5 years I've been in my neighborhood, it's almost all completely new people. There are 2 families on my street that are still here from the beginning. Most people seem to  move within 3 years. Compare that to when i was growing up in the 90s and 2000s, everyone in my parents neighborhood had been there for decades and everyone knew everyone. It's hard to keep up and build relationships when people just up and leave. My neighborhood growing up was semi rural though whereas now I'm in an Atlanta suburb, don't know if that's making a difference but it definitely seems like as soon as you become closer friends with the neighbors they leave. There are people in my parent's neighborhood that have lived there since the houses were built in the late 60s. I really miss it, so i try to help it happen.

And more to the point, I wonder even if I save up, get the things that give me stability, what's the point if all the things I enjoyed were jettisoned out of existence/out of reach? Imagine you were given a mansion for free, but your hobbies themself were inaccessible. Your passions nolonger tangible. Maybe get lucky and find something similar, but that's largely made me yearn for the things I can't have or experience anymore.

I've never thought life was about propagating the species. I always thought it was about fulfillment. So what does one do when fulfillment is inaccessible? When you are removed from it (by moving, by disability, by companies going under, etc. there's many ways this can happen) and nothing fills the void left by it. 

Couple that with friends leaving, and it leaves a big resounding “meh.” (fortunately, this has been a slightly more stable aspect in my life for now, but I see so so so many struggle with this, and I do fear it will get worse with me.

swheels125,hiekhu3,"The concept of digital ownership is going to be an interesting legal problem. As an example, I have bought maybe 25 movies over the years on my Amazon prime account. I purchased them and “own” them in much the same way as I would a DVD, but if Amazon was to ever remove that movie from the platform, they are not required to provide a refund or physical copy. If we compared this to physical ownership, it’s as if Walmart stopped selling Harry Potter dvd’s AND came and stole your Harry Potter dvd that you already owned. However, in that comparison, Walmart also has to pay to hold on to your dvd while you own it and also pay to run your DVD player aka the platform. It’s a complicated situation.

Edit: to all the people saying I bought access rights and don’t own it, I am aware. That’s why “own” is in quotation marks. I’m certain that if I really read through the T&Cs it would say I own nothing of what I have paid for and they could wipe my account and tell me to piss off if they so chose. The “owning it similar to a dvd” sentiment is about the practice of buying a movie and having it on your digital shelf as opposed to physical shelf being very much the same.",753,What is slowly dying off or disappearing?,MidnightLostChild_,/r/AskReddit/comments/qhodzh/what_is_slowly_dying_off_or_disappearing/hiekhu3/,0.039,0.046,0.915,-0.4215

ColonelMoseby,hif35ph,"The research I read does not support this. Native bees and honeybees (not native to North America) use the same blooming plants for nectar, but the resource is pretty robust. No papers I have read suggest competition for nectar between native and introduced species—there are a lot of flowers out there.

The real issue is habitat loss. Native bees tend to nest in the ground or in dried plant stems/wood. They like “weeds” (aka native plants) and bare dirt, not hybrid flowers and turf grass. So those endless subdivisions with green lawns and sterile landscaping plants are a desert for native bees. Honeybees are valued pollinators for crops, so don’t dis them. 

To do your part: set aside bare dirt in your yard. Let some native plants grow. Leave some sticks and plant stems for nest sites. Bees are very cool to watch, and they do some really weird things.

We don't use ""weed"" killers on our dandelions or clover either.  We have birds, snakes, skunks, foxes, rabbits, etc.  We love the fact our yard is an animal habitat.

The neighbor   claimed the native plant  islands, which have their own decorative borders, were ""neglected"" areas and were a code violation.  

The code enforcement officer came out, took a look, and said they were considered legal landscaping.  

Then he investigated the property lines and  fined the neighbor who called in the complaint for building his privacy fence directly on the property line.    Code says you have to leave a few  feet offset.  Which we did when we installed our picket fence.  

Our neighbor had to tear down the fence, have it resurveyed, and reinstalled.  He also had to remove his shed and relocate it.

I was trapped in a parking garage because their computers froze. I was just coming back from dinner with family and some people had been waiting in the computer pay room waiting for parking services for over an hour at that point.

Well, just so you are all aware, garage doors are required to have a safety open/close button right beside the door. Additionally the arm blocking your car can just be pushed out of the way with a very slight effort by hand.

Needless to say, I was not going to wait at a parkade for however long it took the repair man to show up, so I let my girlfriend drive my car and directed all the trapped people to leave at the same time. Then I opened the door, broke the arm and had my gf pick me up a few blocks away.

It’s not something I would normally do, and I WAS more than happy to pay for a functional service.

The bolts are designed to snap at a certain amount of pressure to avoid damage to the mechanism. Know that many parking gate arm breakaway bolts only work properly if the arm is forced vertically. Forcing horizontally (such as driving your car through it) can absolutely destroy the apparatus. Breakaway bolts cost $10-$20. The gate arm motor costs $8,000-$12,000.

Amaru_Boo,hikuu8i,"“Survival of the fittest”, what most people think is that a fit, healthy organism is what survival of the fittest pertains to but it’s simply not true.

Fitness is a measure of ones ability to reproduce viable offspring. Viable means kids who are able to have kids and so forth. It’s not meant to be whoever is the strongest. 

For example a peacock that has a lot of fitness has a long tail. This tail however drags on the ground, collecting flees and other vermin that affect the health of the bird. Not to mention getting caught by predators. If it rains and the tail gets dirty and mud dries on it it has a harder time taking off and avoiding predators.

However a male with a short tail doesn’t have any of those things happen to it and yet it doesn’t produce like a long-tailed peacock does. The purpose of the tail is to score a female. If you have a short tail and are healthier it means absolutely nothing. Your genes do not pass on and therefore you don’t technically “survive”.

Another thing people commonly get wrong is evolution but that’s a story for another day. I’m mentioning it because it sort of ties into survival of the fittest.

Trapptor,hikco8z,"I feel like this whole debate is either the result of people having very different philosophies about what it means to care about something, or just folks wanting to feel smug about applying basic logic.  It could also be about what constitutes “right” when comparing phrases, but I’ve never seen anyone actually dig that far into the concept.

Can you vary how much you care about something?  If not, “I couldn’t care less” is a truism, and is as equally true if you don’t care at all as it is if you care quite a bit.

If you have the capacity to care about something more or less, and you’re telling me how little you care about it, couldn’t you have chosen to care a little bit less and just not bring it up at all?  (I see this argument made and rejected, but not refuted, fairly often).

Again, I understand some people like to have this argument because it lets them feel smart for applying a little bit of logic (“well if you could care less than you must care more than someone who couldn’t care less!”), but it’s frustrating that people that make that argument seem to refuse to engage with any analysis beyond that, or to even consider why someone might want to express that they are currently at one point within a range instead of just using more words to say something that has the exact same meaning as “I don’t care.”

Imagine you’re talking to a friend who says “I couldn’t care less about Disney movies, but my kids love them”.

Now imagine the friend instead says “I could care less about Disney movies, but my kids love them”.

Do people really not see that these are different statements conveying different information?  And if you had to pick one of those phrases that better described the situation, which would it be?  Do we really expect that how much the friend cares about Disney movies would not at all be affected by how the kids feel about Disney movies?

Or, said differently, if someone says “I couldn’t care less,” it’s usually not that hard to think of situations in which they could indeed care less.",0,What is a phrase you are tired of being used incorrectly?,theoriginalamanda,/r/AskReddit/comments/qijftd/what_is_a_phrase_you_are_tired_of_being_used/hikco8z/,0.236,0.058,0.706,0.9981

Frequently Asked Questions About irregardless
Is irregardless a word?
Yes. It may not be a word that you like, or a word that you would use in a term paper, but irregardless certainly is a word. It has been in use for well over 200 years, employed by a large number of people across a wide geographic range and with a consistent meaning. That is why we, and well-nigh every other dictionary of modern English, define this word. Remember that a definition is not an endorsement of a word’s use.
Does irregardless mean the same thing as regardless?
Yes. We define irregardless as ""regardless."" Many people find irregardless to be a nonsensical word, as the ir- prefix usually functions to indicate negation; however, in this case it appears to function as an intensifier. Similar ir- words, while rare, do exist in English, including irremediless (""remediless""), irresistless (""resistless"") and irrelentlessly (""relentlessly).
Is irregardless slang?
We label irregardless as “nonstandard” rather than “slang.” When a word is nonstandard it means it is “not conforming in pronunciation, grammatical construction, idiom, or word choice to the usage generally characteristic of educated native speakers of a language.” Irregardless is a long way from winning general acceptance as a standard English word. For that reason, it is best to use regardless instead.

“Blood is thicker than water” came before “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb.”

“Blood is thicker than water is a medieval proverb in English meaning that familial bonds will always be stronger than bonds of friendship or love. The oldest record of this saying can be traced back in the 12th century in German.”

“Two modern commentators, author Albert Jack[10] and Messianic Rabbi Richard Pustelniak,[11] claim that the original meaning of the expression was that the ties between people who have made a blood covenant (or have shed blood together in battle) were stronger than ties formed by ""the water of the womb"", thus ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb"".

ScallopOolong,hiko099,"This is right. The OED goes into some detail about it. The ""axe"" form they describe as ""metathesis of /sk/ to /ks/"", and  that it is well attested in Old English, mainly late West Saxon"", and in Middle English more widely throughout the midlands and south of England. In Modern English in many dialects from all over the world. Also that the form has ""long been regarded as nonstandard (the anonymous *Writing Scholar's Compan.* (1695) describes *ax* as vulgar), although they reflect the usual pronunciation of the word in many regional varieties of English.""

They provide a number of examples from Old English, like:

>c1175  (▸OE)    Ælfric *Homily* (Bodl. 343) in S. Irvine *Old Eng. Homilies* (1993) 39: Ða **axode** Petrus: Hu ofte sceal ic forȝifæn?

And Middle English:

>1549   H. Latimer *1st Serm. before Kynges Grace* sig. Biiii: The other **axed** ye price, he sayd: xx. nobels.

GrilledStuffedDragon,hijq188,">Nowadays, this phrase is used to imply that family relationships are more important than friendships, often suggesting that family should be prioritised. However, the full quote is actually “the blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb”, which has the exact opposite meaning. The original meaning actually doesn’t refer to family at all and instead comes from the idea that a bond made with someone that you’ve shed blood with (in the past this would have been a literal reference to battle) is stronger than one had with someone you’ve shared the womb with.

>The first reference to anything similar to this was 1180 in ‘Reynard the Fox’ by Heinrich der Glîchezære and was written as “Kin-blood is not spoilt by water.” The form “blood is thicker than water” appeared in 1670 in John Ray’s work ‘Proverbs’ although the ‘invention’ of the phrase is credited to Sir Walter Scott (from his 1815 novel ‘Guy Mannering’). Truthfully the phrase has been borrowed from many places and altered throughout time.

Sometimes there is a loss of precision in language-- if a word starts to be used to mean to many things than the word becomes less useful. In the short-term this is a problem, but as the word becomes increasingly less useful a new word will inevitably be invented or change to meet the need that was created.  
  
Trying to change any of this is like trying to hold back the tide with your hands. Unless Sisyphean tasks are appealing to you, I highly recommend you simply embrace the fact that words change over time to the greatest extent possible, and recognize that sometimes culture doesn't make sense and occasionally creates completely incomprehensible definitions, and that's OK.

There are two moments.

1. High School Graduation - I was never popular in high school. I was very much the nerdy kid that nobody talked to and I had one friend throughout all four years. Nonetheless, I was the valedictorian of the class of 2014 which meant I got to give the speech. I actually gave two unrelated speeches in my high school career in front of the entire school and community (I won the Veteran's Day Essay Contest back-to-back years, if you need to know) and had ironically developed a reputation as a very talented speaker. So when I gave my speech, it was brilliant and I was, at least for a day, a goddamn celebrity.
2. College Graduation - There is no good explanation for how I managed to graduate from college. While I was a star student in high school, I was quite the opposite in university. I struggled with depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts the entire time and very nearly didn't finish. Somehow I found a way, though, and I walked across the stage, albeit a semester late.

Some of my happiest times have also been spent at car shows. There is an annual show in a small town close to where I live where the town turns into American Grafitti for one night. It is absolutely amazing. When we head home early the next morning I am already looking forward to next year.

So, today we had a Halloween event an my high school and I asked for paper to clean my painted face, she gave me one and I tried to get out the paint, I then asked her if the paint was gone, and sayed no, while she gets another paper for me. Somehow I got the balls to ask if she could help me. She accepted. I looked around while she was clearing the paint and there was some people looking at us, very embarrassing. Then I looked at her and she was smiling. I froze in place looking at her and realized I loved her.

It might not sound like the best day of my life, but after two years of not having any improvements on life, depression and some days being on the edge of crying in middle of class, I'm very happy and I've never felt something that incredible in years.

The 240sx later that year and I went to a drifting track in Oregon, and when I slammed it into 3rd gear at a 45 degree turn, my clutch stopped working, and the car would stop, I was gonna engine break it but it was to late, 3 cars slammed into mine and then it tumbled. The chassis was completely bent and would’ve costed a FORTUNE to fix. Plus it had some illegal tunes on it so there was no way my Insurance was gonna fix it.

EgyptianDevil78,hij1bas,"I usually follow a rigorous prep routine ~1-2 weeks before any presentation I give. Or, rather, in two halves (which allows for the scenario where I don't always have 2 weeks notice).

The first half I write up my note cards and then I practice my presentation with notecards in hand. The goal is to only glance at the cards to remind myself of the highlights. 

The second half, I wean myself off the cards. I allow myself to present off the cuff and make note of areas of the speech where I tend to deviate from the exact wording of the cards. I let those deviations be and *rehearse* them so that I know what I will be inclined to say once I am presenting in front of actual people. 

First half is preparatory, second half is a dry-run rehearsal series that allows me to understand what I **actually** will say when I can't look at the cards for guidance.


I know that *my* anxiety around public speaking is that I am afraid of what I will do when I am presenting.

NeutralGoodguy,hijy4fc,"Luckily, I have a grossly misplaced sense of self confidence, so I've never had any issues with this. My best friend does, though.

I will first talk about how I think about stuff like that, as that might already help you; helped my friend a little, anyway. Usually, when you give a presentation, there's noone in the room (apart from maybe a teacher or sth) who knows more about the topic at hand than you do, so it shouldn't be a problem at all, really. Depending on what exactly makes you nervous, I could probably give a different answer, but generally speaking, it usually boils down to something along those lines.

For my friend, it helped to have someone with a grossly misplaced sense of self confidence beside him. I realize this is not always a possibility, as - especially after school - you might need to do stuff on your own, but whenever he had a blackout of sorts (which happened quite regularly), I'd just pipe in and talk about whatever shit I wanted to talk about for a moment, until he managed to get a hold of it so he could go back to talking.   
Another thing that helped him was just having notes. Before the presentation, you can stare into them and repeat them over and over, to focus yourself, which will eventually lead to you calming down a little. During the actual presentation, you can still stare into your notes from time to time; it's considered bad behaviour, but if it helps you, it's definetely better than being nervous as heck.  
If staring into your notes doesn't help or just ends up making it worse, you might just want to talk to someone about whatever. You might try loosening yourself up before giving the presentation by talking about - say - your favourite type of food and how you made it the last time you did, if there's something interesting involved. Or whatever video game you're currently playing. Or a book, movie, whatever. Something nice and fun. 

Hope this helps.",2,How do you overcome nerves before giving a presentation?,OrdinaryMind4486,/r/AskReddit/comments/qig4r3/how_do_you_overcome_nerves_before_giving_a/hijy4fc/,0.153,0.062,0.785,0.9856

PlayerH8rsBallz,hikg6sl,"Every day is a new day full of new experiences and information my brain may, or may not, choose to pay attention to. I don't really have control over what it decides to focus on, and when. 

When I have to learn a new thing, it's basically like flipping a coin: Heads my brain decides to pay attention and learn it, tails my brain doesn't pay attention and I retain nothing and it takes me 10x as long to learn it as it would for someone else of equal intelligence. 

Emotionally...I have to take a moment and think about pretty much any feeling I'm having, in order to determine if it's appropriate or not. Am I taking this too personally? Is it even personal? Why am I mad? Am I spiraling aka hyper-fixating on something and it's making me super angry or sad? When I was younger, the impulsive emotional shit I used to do, and not understanding why no one else felt so intensely, makes me cringe to this day. 

Sometimes I have to do something, it could even be important, and there I am *not doing it*. 

Sometimes I will forget about something entirely, for who knows how long. It could be important. It could be expensive. All of a sudden 6 months have gone by. 

It's also kind of like having a massive series of collapsed links that just, open and unfold in infinite directions within your mind at the drop of a hat and so you can pull from any of them and make really unique and creative connections, but it's blinding and comes at the detriment of linear thinking.  

Basically I spent most of my life feeling just, bad, at everything. Way behind everyone, at everything. Incapable of doing things that seemed so basic and easy for other people. Being told I had so much potential. Disappointing people and failing at things, *constantly*. 

It fucking sucks and it's one of those mental illnesses that is extremely detrimental in our modern society. It also hurts interpersonal relationships because people think you just don't give a shit. I'm glad I got diagnosed, I'm glad I have it under control now.

FreudsGoodBoy,hieozev,"Story time: once my roommate invited me to the yearly summer party at his workplace. He worked for an expensive and fancy restaurant downtown, and all the food at this party was amazing. The crown jewel of this edible extravaganza was an entire roast pig. 

There was also a woman a table over who was by my scale a 9. Absolutely gorgeous in every conceivable way. The party was reaching its tail end and I regretted that I never got a chance to talk with her. 

Everyone had eaten, and it was time for people to grab leftovers. Nobody seemed all that interested in the pig, which seemed insane to me, so I was over there with a butcher’s knife and was just cutting off swaths of excellent meat and a few bones for soup and some fat for cooking. (The parts from this pig kept me fed for nearly 6 months.) 

The ludicrously attractive woman came up to me, and started trying to flirt with me.

With cocktail shrimp, the tail can serve as a handle, but if I have to pick the shrimp out of the dish to remove the tail, the experience is worsened.",158,What pisses you off when eating?,Suspicious_Block7385,/r/AskReddit/comments/qhkap7/what_pisses_you_off_when_eating/hiddn0q/,0.041,0.09,0.869,-0.6542
Secret_Map,hidp8y5,"(Sorry, long story)  I was in Japan a few years ago staying at a homestay.  We were there over the 4th of July, so the family wanted to do a ""traditional"" American grill thing in their yard for us and get sparklers.  So we went to the grocery, picked up all kinds of beef and veggies and chicken and great food for the grill.

The homestay ""dad"" was a bit of a stinker, jolly sort of guy, and picked up some sea snails in the shell, totally trying to scare us with them.  His wife tried to tell him no, but he did it anyway lol.  

So we get back, grill up some great food, have some beer, and he throws those guys on the grill in their shell.  After a while, he basically dares me to eat one with him thinking I wouldn't.  I hate bugs, and if I were anywhere else, I wouldn't think about it.  But it felt like such a dare, and I was in Japan and your brain just sorta says ""fuck it, this isn't real, you're in another country"" when you travel overseas, so I did.  

You take a little pick, open up the shell, stick the pick in the snail's head, and sorta uncurl it out of it's shell.  Then dip it in some soy sauce and down the hatch.  It really wasn't that bad, though it looked super gross.  The only bleh part was there was some really bitter flavor in parts of it.  

He kinda laughed and said let's try another, I said ok, open it up and uncurl.  This time, he said pull off the back part that's kinda dark brown/black.  It popped right off, and we tossed that away, then ate just the top half.  It tasted much better, no bitter flavor.  I asked what that back half was and why it tasted better.  He said the back half is where all the poop is lol.  He said most people pull that part off, but he wanted me to try the whole thing for my first one, that bastard.  Ended up having one more (with the back off).  Don't think I'd do it again, but it was a fun experience.",22,What pisses you off when eating?,Suspicious_Block7385,/r/AskReddit/comments/qhkap7/what_pisses_you_off_when_eating/hidp8y5/,0.13,0.053,0.817,0.9881

So we haul ass across town and walk in with half an ambulance of equipment to see a fat guy looking at us like we’re crazy. Ended up walking him to his car and encouraged him to never use this urgent care again because they have a long history of being terrible healthcare providers. 

That same clinic closes at 430 so we used to get a lot of calls around 415 for transports just because they didn’t want to stay late to handle a patient. 

That same clinic also called us for a cardiac arrest which turned out to be an old guy with a-fib (an irregular heart rhythm that isn’t immediately life threatening). We walk in to find the nicest old man you’ll ever meet completely alone with no idea why ems was there. After talking to the patient and realizing he was fine I left my paramedic partner with him and went and chewed the doctors ass for patient abandonment. 

To my knowledge this clinic is the worst medical facility in the world.

LadyOfVoices,hidtl9e,"I had this happen once in high school. My class (about 32 people) was about to go on a spelunking field trip, and I quickly ate the cafeteria food before we left.     
However, a fishbone got stuck in my throat, sideways, like you mentioned.       
I could barely breathe and my eyes were watering. It hurt like a bitch.       
My class was already walking down the street, so I couldn’t call for help (I couldn’t talk either).        
I remembered that I had a pair of scissors in my desk, so I ran to get them, went to the bathroom, and stuck the scissors down my throat to get the fishbone.      
It was lodged, no way to pull it out in one go.     
I ended up cutting it in half, and pulling the two halves out one by one, all the while trying not to gag or swallow.     

After I got it out, I managed to catch up to my class waiting in the bus stop, and we had a grand time spelunking.

Polubing,hie6axt,"ACV = apple cider vinegar. This is the most effective vinegar in my opinion because it smells very close to fermenting fruit, which they like.
