brownej,hjytgla,"> Semantic satiation is a psychological phenomenon in which repetition causes a word or phrase to temporarily lose meaning for the listener, who then perceives the speech as repeated meaningless sounds. Extended inspection or analysis (staring at the word or phrase for a lengthy period of time) in place of repetition also produces the same effect.

Is this going to return a boolean or an integer? Is anything non-zero considered 'True'? What is the actual integer value of 'True'; i.e., is it 1 or -1? What I'm getting at is whether there's a requirement to explicitly return 'True' or 'False', or could you just return the result of the modulus, which technically would be an integer rather than a boolean, and would be 1 rather than -1.

Also, would there be an advantage in terms of execution speed to do a binary AND against 1 rather than the modulus? Most processors can execute an AND faster than an integer divide.

I was like, new date() string is somehow not gmt or the correct time zone but yesterday for some reason, what language does that, vuejs sometimes needs the function to be written ()=> {} and not function(){}, how would I know that beforehand? some things want to be this and others self, some things like arrays needs to be mutated and not replaced, ..etc.

Bo_Jim,hjwhyuz,"Ok. The reason I asked is because a modulus is not a boolean operation. It's a numeric operation, in this case an integer operation. The result is going to be an integer. Most languages consider any non-zero value to be True, but do have an explicit value when the keyword True is used. You can see what this value is if you cast True to an integer to set an integer variable. In some languages it's 1 (only the LS bit is set). In others it's -1 (all bits are set). This usually doesn't make any difference if the test is a simple ""if True..."", but with some languages it becomes important if the test is ""if n == True"". The first is a boolean test. The second is a numeric comparison. Do you see the angle I'm getting at?

Because I don't know Python, I don't know if it's necessary to perform the numeric comparison and, based on the result, explicitly return the boolean state. You answered this - the result of the numeric comparison is implicitly cast to a boolean state. This is the same way most languages work, and I suspected how Python would also work, but I wanted it verified.

The precision of integers isn't really important for the bitwise AND test. Only the least significant bit matters, regardless of the width of the integer. If the LS bit is zero then the value is even. Performing a bitwise AND should always produce the correct results, and should execute faster than an integer division on most processors.",0,"It works, so what's the problem?",_PM_ME_PANGOLINS_,/r/badcode/comments/qpaxtq/it_works_so_whats_the_problem/hjwhyuz/,0.111,0.023,0.867,0.9754

ws-ilazki,hjw9cjk,"> do we need this one-line function? 

Yes.

> why not directly use the condition

One reason, and possibly the most important, is that the named function makes your code more declarative. When you see something like `is_odd(x)` you immediately understand what the *intent* is without having to stop and parse out the logic of whatever way the person is determining it. 

Separating the implementation from the intent like that is generally good for readability.  For example, given these two versions of the same bit of code:

    List.filter (fun i -> i mod 2 = 1) [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
    List.filter is_odd [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]

the latter will be more immediately understandable to someone, even if they've never seen that language (OCaml) before.  With the former, even if you know the language in question, you still have to stop and think about what you're doing there:  you know you're filtering a list of numbers somehow, but it's not immediately obvious *how*, so you have to stop parsing that and make a mental context switch to figure out what the filter actually is.  And that's with a really simple example; it gets harder when you start doing more complex things.

Another argument for it is it makes it easier to take advantage of optimisations in the future.  Let's say you originally wrote an `is_odd` like the one OP posted and used it everywhere, then had an ""omfg I'm a dumbass!"" moment and realised how much easier it *could* be.  You could just change the implementation *once* and your entire codebase now takes advantage of that change.

Whereas if you just done it directly whenever you needed it, you'd have to go back and replace *every instance of it* to get the same benefit.

Also, it reduces boilerplate.  That's one of the reasons for using things like `map` and `filter` from functional programming instead of writing loops.  You tend to write loops a lot, so why not abstract away the actual looping into a function that informs of the intent (map, filter, etc.).  It might be a couple lines longer than writing out the loop once, but long-term it means writing less boilerplate code, and if improvements to those functions are ever made (like finding a better way to optimise them for speed) you can can reap the benefits *everywhere* without having to go through and change everything.",7,"It works, so what's the problem?",_PM_ME_PANGOLINS_,/r/badcode/comments/qpaxtq/it_works_so_whats_the_problem/hjw9cjk/,0.127,0.028,0.844,0.9906

stone_henge,hjwzwfo,"> That's a good way to instantly have your code refactored in the next pull.

What, you don't review code to weed stuff you don't like out before you merge?

If you're using a dynamically typed language only to add run-time type checks to everything you're using the wrong category of languages: you get all the developer overhead of a statically typed language but instead of causing build-time errors you'll learn of mistakes at run-time.

The current state of the art if you want type checking in Python is to add hints and apply a static checker like mypy, but that's far from the norm yet. Take for example the almost universally installed `requests` library. No type hints. No static checking. As most Python code, very little explicit run-time checking. Turns out that's kind of the idea behind dynamically typed languages.

No, that's not the word I wanted.  Writing out the steps *precisely* is explicit, and that's what you're avoiding by moving that logic elsewhere.  Like the example I gave, `filter is_odd list` is declaring intent rather than explicitly stating the control flow necessary to achieve it, thus declarative. It's not telling how to iterate over the list to filter, and it's not telling how `is_odd` is to be implemented, it's saying ""filter this list with the `is_odd` function"" without providing explicit details about either part.

The implementation of `is_odd` itself likely won't be declarative, but that's beside the point, which was that the code *calling* `is_odd` becomes more descriptive of its purpose because it's not being filled with implementation details.",1,"It works, so what's the problem?",_PM_ME_PANGOLINS_,/r/badcode/comments/qpaxtq/it_works_so_whats_the_problem/hjwz07y/,0.014,0.013,0.973,0.0129

ws-ilazki,hjh9kwg,">  Part of my perspective is coming from Python

To be fair, Python's pretty hostile to FP concepts by design because Guido van Rossum has been very anti-FP for literally decades at this point. For example, there's no actual *reason* you can't have multi-line anonymous functions in Python; I've seen people claim the whitespace sensitivity is the reason, but that's bullshit considering F# and Haskell are both whitespace-sensitive and somehow manage it.  (Honourable mention: OCaml *isn't* whitespace sensitive, but looks very much like one at a glance due to clever syntax design.)  GvR didn't want them because he's anti-FP, that was the reason, and anything else said was just an excuse.  He's made all kinds of ignorant, ridiculous, and outright false claims about FP in the past.

So, if you're primarily a Python programmer, it's not a surprise that you'd find the growing use of FP concepts unusual.  While you *can* manage some FP in Python it's just fighting against the current because the language goes out of its way to make it hard for you, so anybody that's mostly using Python will end up finding FP stuff weird. 

> I guess in my ideal world there would be a way to apply the `this`-binding and constness features to a normal function definition so arrow functions aren't needed in cases like this.

That's just an unfortunate side effect (heh) of JS being a week-and-a-half project with a lot of design flaws baked in from the start.  There's no reason a language can't provide sugar to make things cleaner.  For example, Lua's a statement-oriented, primarily procedural language, but it has first-class functions and uses them to implement a lot of its features, using syntactic sugar to make it nicer.  So, for example, this:

    function identity (x)
      return x
    end

is really doing this\*:

    identity = function (x)
      return x
    end

and since functions can be declared `local` (e.g. `local identity = function ...`), you can also do `local function identity ...` as well and it translates accordingly, with the small addition of it also adding a forward declaration so that recursion works without error, similar to how OCaml requires explicit recursion annotation (`let rec function_name ...` for a recursive function).

OOP syntax is similarly just sugar, with its method calling syntax of `foo:bar(baz)` really being `foo.bar(foo, baz)` with the first-argument object being implicitly provided.  Which again is really just sugar over `foo[""bar""](foo, baz)` because the dot notation is shorthand for table (hash map) key access.

But JS has a lot of kludgy history that it has to work around and backward compatibility requirements to think about, so sometimes the late-coming nice additions get stuck with a less-nice syntax because the good stuff was taken on a first-come-first-served basis.  

Emacs actually has had to deal with something like that with regard to variable scope.  Emacs Lisp, being a very old language uses dynamic binding by default, whereas the rest of the world has more-or-less unanimously moved on to lexical binding.  Luckily, they introduced it as an [opt-in feature](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LexicalBinding) so you can, on a per-file basis, enable lexical binding and use it without breaking dynamic binding anywhere else. 

It'd be nice to see more languages do something similar, where you can opt-in to language features for *your* code without breaking compatibility.  Haskell has a similar feature for enabling optional language extensions, but most languages don't do anything of the sort :(

Imagine a JS where you could opt out of the old cruft and have function declarations work as expected, etc. by providing some kind of ""use modern JS"" pragma, without having it break legacy code that doesn't use it.",1,I've got another one for you all,kaamibackup,/r/badcode/comments/qmzlfg/ive_got_another_one_for_you_all/hjh9kwg/,0.088,0.063,0.849,0.9658
jaxklax,hjhflhx,"Thanks for writing all of this, lol.  I've never used Lua or Emacs Lisp so it's interesting to hear about some of their features.  It's a bit odd that you mention multi-line lambdas in Python as an anti-FP example.  The body of a pure function is just an expression, and lambda functions in Python support arbitrary return expressions, even if they span multiple lines (using parentheses).  So it seems what you're objecting to is not a restriction that gets in the way of a functional style, but instead a restriction that gets in the way of defining procedural functions using assignment syntax.  I can't think of why that would be useful in Python; `def` works just fine.

This also kind of applies to the original code in the post; the arrow function isn't really being used to accomplish functional programming in this case; it's being used to define a function that, while pure, is implemented with procedural syntax.  My problem isn't with functional programming, it's with the syntactic oddity of using arrow assignments for procedural functions.

Incidentally, I also disagree about Python.  I am primarily a Python programmer, but I tend to write in a relatively functional style (using `map`, `filter`, and comprehensions, and limiting mutability).  There are some exceptions, but I generally find that Python lends itself pretty well to a functional style.  Although it's very possible my programming style has been shaped by Python, so I don't often realize what's missing.",1,I've got another one for you all,kaamibackup,/r/badcode/comments/qmzlfg/ive_got_another_one_for_you_all/hjhflhx/,0.107,0.052,0.841,0.9173

If Python were an expression-based language like OCaml, the distinction of ""you can have a multi-line expression but not multiple statements"" would matter less, but it's not.  So it's an arbitrary distinction [because GvR just doesn't like multi-line lambdas](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=147358).

It's not necessarily a ""fuck you, FP fans"" decision, but I wasn't trying to imply it was; I was saying that, *because* he has an anti-FP bent, he tends to make decisions that make FP style inconvenient and *doesn't care* that that's the case because he dislikes it anyway.

And him being anti-FP isn't a particularly contentious statement, considering [things he said in this interview](https://developers.slashdot.org/story/13/08/25/2115204/interviews-guido-van-rossum-answers-your-questions) where he claims he knows very little about FP but still declares it to not be ""mainstream reaady"", only sees FP primitives like `map` and `reduce` because ""almost exclusively used (a) to implement sum(), or (b) to write unreadable code"", and called `functools` ""a dumping ground for stuff [he doesn't] really care about"". 

He said similar things in [this blog post](https://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196) where he originally intended to drop map, filter, and reduce *completely*, even suggesting that `reduce` is only useful for associative operators.

His general ignorance about FP [also showed back when he completely misunderstood what tail-call optimisation is](http://neopythonic.blogspot.com/2009/04/tail-recursion-elimination.html) (in addition to not even knowing what it's *called*, and then attacked his self-constructed strawman as justification for why TCO is unnecessary in Python.

He has never understood FP well and has always held it in a certain contempt, and it's shown in Python's language design, and that means that people who have only/primarily used Python end up with a strangely skewed misunderstanding of FP.  That was all I was saying, though I was trying to avoid going too deeply into it.

> I can't think of why that would be useful in Python; `def` works just fine.

Having a consistency of behaviour is generally better than having one type of function definition be a special case where you can/cannot do various things.  (Which is also something I don't like about JS with its different declaration styles with subtly different semantics.)

I typically agree with the idea of making locally scoped functions and giving them a name instead of embedding large anonymous functions into the middle of an expression, but there are times it's not necessarily cleaner.  There are times, for example, when it makes sense to store functions in a complex data type like an array or hash map, and it's not necessarily cleaner or better to have a bunch of intermediate named functions for the sole purpose of making the interpreter happy because someone had a bug up his ass about FP.  

This actually comes up a lot in Lua tables. (I know I keep mentioning Lua, but it makes interesting examples being a non-FP language that still relies on some fundamental FP designs.) Tables are the only complex data structure, acting as a mix of a hash map (dictionary) and an array, and as such, there are many places in Lua where tables get used to do advanced things, often with functions assigned to keys.  One common example is creating libraries, because when you `foo = require(""foo"")`, Lua reads `foo.lua`, evaluates the contents as a block, and then assigns its return value to `foo`.  So to make a library you'd do something like this:

    local t = {} -- empty table
    
    t.identity = function (x)
      return x
    end
    
    t.add = function (a,b)
      return a + b
    end
    
    t.foo = function (x,y,z)
      -- Some long function here
      -- that requires mutiple lines
    end
    
    return t

Though if most of your exported values are non-functions or small functions, it could make more sense to do it a bit differently:

    -- no intermediate values this way, just build the table and return it.
    return {
      identity = function (x) return x end,
      add = function (a,b) return a + b end,
      foo = function (x,y,z)
        -- this function needs multiple lines
        -- but no implementation is  provided
        -- because fuck that.
      end
    }

If multi-line anonymous functions weren't possible, you'd have to make intermediate local functions first, *then* assign those, and it'd just be pointless boilerplate that doesn't actually improve readability. This is just one semi-contrived example, but the point is that consistency in behaviour is *useful*, because you can make use of it in other ways as well. 

> This also kind of applies to the original code in the post; the arrow function isn't really being used to accomplish functional programming in this case; it's being used to define a function that, while pure, is implemented with procedural syntax.

This is kind of irrelevant to the original topic, but you're a bit confused on FP here.  If a function is *pure* it doesn't matter how it's implemented internally, it can still be used for functional programming. Going back to Lua again since it has first-class functions but no common FP stuff defined out-of-the-box, here's an imperative implementation of `reduce` that can then be used to bootstrap other FP primitives:

    -- Bootstrap with a fold
    reduce = function (f, x, t)
       for _,v in pairs(t) do
          x = f(x,v)
       end
       return x
    end
    
    -- Fold-based map
    map = function (f, t)
      local reducer = function (a, b)
        local t = {table.unpack(a)}
        table.insert (t, f(b))
        return t
      end
      return reduce(reducer, {}, t)
    end
    
    -- Fold-based filter
    filter = function (pred, t)
      local reducer = function (a,b)
        local t = {table.unpack(a)}
         if pred(b) then table.insert(t, b) end
        return t
      end
      return reduce(reducer, {}, t)
    end
    
    -- Reverse function composition, pipeline style, using fold
    -- x = compr(f1,f2,f3); x(10) => f3(f2(f1(10)))
    compr = function (f, ...)
       local fs = {...}
       return function (...)
          return reduce(function (a,f) return f(a) end,
             f(...),
             fs)
       end
    end

    -- Now wrapper over compr for convenience, allowing things like
    -- pipe(70, double, times_five, tostring, string.reverse) == ""007""
    pipe = function (x, ...)
      return compr(...)(x)
    end

`reduce` here is implemented imperatively but it's a pure function that is then used to build other ones and bootstrap FP in Lua.  You *could* do it all with recursion, but it's not necessarily beneficial since the iteration will likely be more performant.  In fact, that's often the case with FP-first languages as well; Clojure, for example, makes heavy use of on-FP style internally for performance reasons, such as doing lots of mutation to avoid copies on FP staples that need to be as fast as possible.  As long as it's still pure, the internal implementation is irrelevant because pure functions are intentionally black boxes where you put a thing in one side, get a new thing out the other, and require no understanding of what happens while the thing's inside the box.  And nothing about that really goes against other aspects of FP.

FP isn't just about using `map` and `filter` in a few places. That stuff's just the gateway drug to it :) Being comfortable with FP means thinking of functions as any other kind of value, rather than something special.  If a function is just data, you expect to be able to use it the same way you could strings or numbers, and doing so opens the door to new ways of thinking about and writing code.

>  Although it's very possible my programming style has been shaped by Python, so I don't often realize what's missing.

Quite likely that's the case.  GvR's anti-FP mindset has led to Python implementing its own way of doing a lot of similar things so you might look at a lot of FP stuff and go ""yeah but I can do <this> in <this way> instead"", but that can be said of any Turing-complete language.  The thing with FP is that there's an elegance to FP concepts and the way that they can usually be applied to some extent in most any language.  My experience has been that, by getting comfortable with FP, it changed how I think about problems in a lot of ways, which is beneficial even outside of FP-first languages.

I'd say check out [the Cornell CS3110 course book](https://cs3110.github.io/textbook/cover.html) some time.  It uses OCaml, which isn't whitespace-sensitive but its expression-based syntax shouldn't be too uncomfortable to someone with Python familiarity. It's not so much a book on learning OCaml as it is a very good introduction to FP that happens to use OCaml, well worth a read.",1,I've got another one for you all,kaamibackup,/r/badcode/comments/qmzlfg/ive_got_another_one_for_you_all/hjhtqpw/,0.088,0.066,0.846,0.9888
jaxklax,hjiegsl,"You're right, I did conflate function purity with implementation style.  I think I see your point about the usefulness of being able to define functions directly in data structures, although I'm not sure that's something I miss very often in Python; generally modules and classes are quite sufficient as code containers.  There may well be tasks out there where the best implementation would ideally involve inline functions in a collection; but in the Slashdot interview you linked Guido explains why he thinks situations like that aren't a big concern, and I think I agree.  The rare practical benefits of a full function expression might not be worth the added syntax complexity for Python.  Maybe it comes down to whether you look at languages more from a practical or theoretical perspective.

Thanks for the book reference; I do think I would benefit from learning about OCaml someday.  I probably don't need an introduction to FP in general since I have taken a course on it, but it would probably be rewarding nonetheless.",1,I've got another one for you all,kaamibackup,/r/badcode/comments/qmzlfg/ive_got_another_one_for_you_all/hjiegsl/,0.149,0.025,0.826,0.9739
ws-ilazki,hjj8c1s,"> although I'm not sure that's something I miss very often in Python; generally modules and classes are quite sufficient as code containers

It's not just about code containers, that's just one example because it's an easy and interesting one.  Just like Lua has no concept of objects and classes, it also doesn't have any sort of namespace or module system either. Because first-class functions enable new ways of doing things, though, it can basically implement those features in pure Lua without touching the interpreter.  A Lua ""namespace"" is just nested tables with functions in some of the keys, so it can sometimes be useful to define that directly instead of having to make a bunch of intermediate functions first.

I didn't really spell it out, but I included those  `compr` and `pipe` functions in the ""bootstrap FP from reduce"" snippet earlier because they're another example of stuffing functions into a complex type, though this time it's an array.  It's not quite as nice as the `|>` pipeline operator in languages like OCaml and F#, but it emulates the same pipeline concept in a way that makes function composition read left-to-right (or top-to-bottom with line breaks) instead of the harder to follow right-to-left style of `foo(bar(baz()))`.  And while it's usually going to be more readable to have named functions in that pipeline, sometimes it does make sense to throw an anonymous function in, so it's good to have it behave like a normal function.

Or hell, it's kind of weird and not common, but *occasionally* it can be useful to just make a nameless function and call it *right then and there*.

> The rare practical benefits of a full function expression might not be worth the added syntax complexity for Python. Maybe it comes down to whether you look at languages more from a practical or theoretical perspective.

Considering everything else that's been added, I don't really think syntax complexity is a good argument against.  I think he just didn't like how it looked and he'd already dismissed lambdas as FP wankery along with map and reduce. Like the one blog post said, lambda,map,etc. got in because a lisper wanted them and submitted a patch, but for Python 3 he was originally determined to use the compatibility break as an excuse to drop them all.  He *only* wanted procedural-style function statements in Python 3.

Which is fine, it was his language to do what he wanted with, and there's nothing wrong with creating an opinionated programming language.  But it's led to the language being less FP-friendly than it could have otherwise been.

>  I probably don't need an introduction to FP in general since I have taken a course on it, but it would probably be rewarding nonetheless.

Might still be worth the read just for a different look at it. Learning FP from multiple angles is what helped me have that lightbulb moment where it really started to make sense and I realised I was thinking in terms of FP and higher-order functions, instead of just using a few common ones sometimes.",1,I've got another one for you all,kaamibackup,/r/badcode/comments/qmzlfg/ive_got_another_one_for_you_all/hjj8c1s/,0.088,0.052,0.86,0.9646

I actually started out my college career in CS and pretty quickly realized it wasn't going to give me what I wanted. I ended up on an entirely different career path, only using my coding skills to solve my own problems, until later on I self-learned up to a professional level and started a career as a software developer. 

I remember one professor who refused to use email (this was in 2001) and another that complained in class about something being annoying to with a mouse, then when I told him the keyboard shortcut he responded with ""I'm too old to be learning new things"". 

There are concepts about von Neumann architecture, boolean logic, and the internals of how a processor works that have all been helpful, but honestly I've learned more about that kind of thing from Ben Eater in the past few months than I did in my few semesters as a CS major.

I went and did interviews at several college CS departments, clearly describing my desired career path as a software developer, and pretty much everyone involved lead me down that path without ever mentioning that CS isn't the right place for someone with my desired career path. 

At that time, none of the schools I went to had a separate program for software engineering. Everything was just under CS. That was 20 years ago now, so I suspect it's changed a bit, especially now that most of the professors teaching started their career without having to submit punch cards for the mainframe, so the mindset has probably changed a bit.

wwelna,hje3spe,"All good questions and observations. 

This was part of a slightly abnormally inspired coding challenge. This was designed and intended to be compiled using Open Watcom C/C++ Version 1.9 targeted for MSDOS, using the 16-bit COM executable / tiny memory model. This means the code as well as all memory had to fit into a little less than 64kb of memory, which lead to some interesting and questionable decisions. (There is, of course, ways around all that, but that wouldn't be much of a challenge)

The current executable is at 15.7kb, and includes a 320x200 VGA -> 40x25 char terminal with custom fonts, which this code is a part of, for a clone / variation of Hunt the Wumpus.",6,"My own atoi() but it works, and that's all that matters in the end.",wwelna,/r/badcode/comments/qn1rkm/my_own_atoi_but_it_works_and_thats_all_that/hje3spe/,0.094,0.013,0.893,0.7236
Ahajha1177,hje45f6,"When you say the ""code"", do you mean the source or the compiled binary? Because in either case, this is still a strange decision.

If you're going for shorter source, just do * 10. If you're going with smaller binary, also do * 10, should be a single instruction instead of the handful of ones that would be.

Also not to mention if you're going for code size, there's a *lot* you could shave off without reducing readability much or at all, for starters you could get rid of those `this->`s all over the place (assuming it isn't referencing something in a base class, but I'm guessing it isn't)",2,"My own atoi() but it works, and that's all that matters in the end.",wwelna,/r/badcode/comments/qn1rkm/my_own_atoi_but_it_works_and_thats_all_that/hje45f6/,0.0,0.013,0.987,-0.1027
wwelna,hje60o4,"By code, I mean all the code in compiled form in the binary.

Multiplication is expensive on CPU cycles compared to bitshifts and addition/subtraction. I've done this in other parts of the code and other ways to decrease screen tearing on updates (can't do double buffering in a normal way, as lack of memory), as speed was also as important. I needed to make sure it compiled that way rather than hoping it would optimize the multiplication that way. 

It's what made this fun to code, after all, as extreme limitations leads to creative problem solving. You could take a look at [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.kkrieger), which has some really creative methods.

- People with bad internet connections who can't load the image for that reason
- People who use third-party clients, mobile apps and\/or text-based browsers that have trouble loading the image at high quality or at all
- People who have trouble reading small, blurry, multi-coloured, or oddly formatted text

It's also useful for search engine indexing, and the transcription can be used as training data to improve OCR technology.

This separates the front end (html display, UI) from the backend (business logic, data serving/transformation) entirely.
