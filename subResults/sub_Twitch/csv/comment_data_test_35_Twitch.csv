x0boo,hjy26ku,"They are bots, they won't count towards your actual follower count. I know it's confusing. Sometimes they're more obvious than others.

Draco1200,hjysrj4,"Users in the chat are not the same as users watching the video stream; if someone joins the channel and then pauses the video or it stops playing for any reason (Such as the error 2000 screen comes up while they're away) -  they are very likely to be still in the chat but Not playing and will not get counted as a view.

Normal chat bots are the same way.    Users such as ""Nightbot"" will be in the ""Chatters list / Viewers list""   and get picked up by any bot you have monitoring the chat,   but they are not actually watching the stream - only the chat,   and therefore,  they never count  towards the viewer numbers from Twitch's point of view.

It is the same situation for all the common bots recognized by Twitchinsights -  lurk bots join peoples' chat but don't watch the stream;  most of those will be legitimate, or not proven to be bad in any way.   It's only  illlegal/malicious bots   that temporarily affect viewer numbers...  and  not exactly a solved problem in computing to instantly identify new bots:  that is an endless war much like the wars between Ads and ad-blocking plugins.    The 
 Twitchinsights sites do not have any magic solution that could stop the malicious bot problem  (They perform much easier task of arbitrarily identifying mostly known bots after the fact by counting how many channels a user is seen in  and assume a user detected to some number, say 100  channels' chat sessions must be a bot, etc).",1,New to twitch and am confused to death,hotdigadydogdafurry,/r/Twitch/comments/qq1uqj/new_to_twitch_and_am_confused_to_death/hjysrj4/,0.054,0.119,0.827,-0.9628

dozyhoe,hjyl43o,"For me personally as a female streamer, sometimes it's really hard to say ""no"". There's this internal fear of lashback from an audience if we make ourselves look disengaging or unwilling to speak with our audience, a fear that includes worry that we'll be doxed, harassed, hate raided, etc. (I've been mass reported because I didn't laugh at some guy's joke.) Sometimes I've started a discussion about something, and later became uncomfortable because of how a viewer spoke about the topic. Our mods are usually pretty good at reading our body language, and can tell when they need to step in to protect the streamer's mental health- that's why they're mods instead of viewers! As streamers we mentally prioritize entertainment, and sometimes our people-pleasing attitudes can prevent us from speaking up for ourselves. If a mod asked you, I would probably listen just to be safe. I'm not at all saying or implying that you made the streamer uncomfortable, but it's better to be safe than sorry just in case you are in that situation and just aren't aware. Some streamers are uncomfortable making that call and rely on their mods to step in, and it's often a discussion they have with mods behind the scenes to let them know what calls they're allowed to make. If you're really curious though, maybe DM the streamer on discord or Twitch and let them know what happened. If it's truly a case of the mod stepping out of line, I'm sure they would want to know about it so that they can speak with the mod and prevent something like that happening again.

I also think that if streamers are uncomfortable putting their foot down in chat, they need to look at why.

That's exactly what I was thinking. If I were discussing a difficult topic like cancel culture on stream, I might want the convo to end without seeming like a spoil sport on stream. 

Last think I want is for it to lead to more questions. ""Are you scared of talking about this?"" ""Why don't you want to keep chatting?"" ""We were having such a good discussion.""

Maybe I'm aware the topic has gone on for too long. Maybe I don't know enough about it. Maybe I'm just uncomfortable with it. But I'd be perfectly fine asking one of my mods to curtail it (either by steering the conversation elsewhere in chat, or by whispering the viewer).

My mods have a list of topics I am NOT okay discussing at all.

Ghastion,hjxywmp,"I think it has to do with how people grew up. Some males get this idea that playing 'as' a female character is emasculating (or with girl toys, girl music, girl tv shows etc.) this ideology sticks with them into adulthood where they feel the need to still make these remarks and think this way. I feel like, it's most-likely just harmless banter for them, but they still see males who play as females as weird. They don't understand it. They think you must be a sexual deviant or something (probably just them projecting tbh).

On the other hand, there's a lot of boys who grow up liking girly stuff and don't have this need to always feel masculine, or play into these social norms. It's a more neutral perspective where you like both feminine and masculine things. With a more neutral perspective, it could go both ways. The gender might feel the other is more aesthetically pleasing due to several reasons such as attraction, but also because they aren't that gender and enjoy that  it's different than themselves (who really wants to be themselves in a video-game anyways). The same people who will shit on males for playing female characters are usually the same people who will say - ""It's a fantasy game, why would I want to play as a Human?""

Also, finding the opposite gender more aesthetically pleasing isn't weird.",2,Is it weird as a male to play a game where you can choose your character to play as female?,ShikiOuji5,/r/Twitch/comments/qq3nn9/is_it_weird_as_a_male_to_play_a_game_where_you/hjxywmp/,0.18,0.026,0.794,0.9905

Nested categories would group series altogether (Zelda, Pokémon, Mario, Elder Scrolls, Persona, GTA...) into bigger overarching categories, grouping content creators and consolidating viewerbases altogether, while also resolving the problem of ""creating division in the community with different versions of games"", because you could always browser the entire category for a game (ie Pokémon Diamond) instead of looking at a single game each time (ie Pokémon Brilliant Diamond).

Nested categories would also help with non-gaming categories, and separate things like music into Rock, Jazz, Techno... programming into different languages like Java, C++, C#, Python... Sports into Football (Soccer), Basketball, Golf...

This could help bringing communities together while having the possibility to browse overarching categories for a broader view on an entire topic/subject.

 The same could work for retro games.

EroAxee,hjumzxq,">I don't want to have to hunt for the correct game and wonder if I didn't find it or if it's under the German name instead.

Just chiming in here, that would be completely avoided with multiple categories?

You could just go, alright I want \_ board game, let's check the category, hmm can't find it/not interested in streamers/something else so lets check the Board Games category and wow, there's people there streaming it as well.

The only difference is that right now you can have a small community *or sometimes relatively small community* be stunted in growth by either having a community in their category or needing to absolutely **sift** through the giant categories.

For example, I enjoy watching streamers that play Thief: The Dark Project and Thief II: The Metal Age (can't say Thief cause of the darn reboot).  If I was to look for that in Retro I would be basically unable to find it, even though it could be classified as one and there's probably a few people there.  It also means that anyone randomly browsing Retro or some other category can't find streamers on the game though.

And a lot of people would assume that a game as old as it is wouldn't have people streaming it like they do but you'd be surprised the community around it.  Now that's one of the larger examples, but still, it can super hurt specific categories, but also hurt people being put into a saturated category, it's not like it would be difficult to implement, they have a tags system, just have categories allowing adding related categories or extras.  

They have auto tags on different streams depending on the game already.  Just add in related categories there, it would require a bit of restructuring but I don't really see the downside for streamers, you're shown in 2 separate categories both with their own traffic.  A Retro or Board Game watcher may find a game they've never seen, and a person who knows the category but may not know or classify the game there can find it within it's own category.",3,Twitch NEEDS to support dual categories.

I know people who’ve thrown hundreds of dollars into making their set up look original, but they still have 3-4 viewers on average because they can’t hold anyone’s attention. 

To start, do something basic on Canva or some other free website, and see how streaming goes for you. As you build an audience, start investing in upgrading the overlays if you feel like it’s necessary!",3,"How important are custom Twitch overlays, intermission Screens etc.?",MomoJackson96,/r/Twitch/comments/qq0407/how_important_are_custom_twitch_overlays/hjxesmb/,0.124,0.04,0.836,0.9018

And it's a demanding job even for the people at the top. Streaming is very similar. Very few make decent money, and it doesn't come easy to those who do. It's alot of work. And streaming is actually only a small part of that for those at the top. It's alot of boring meetings with sponsors, lawyers, accountants, influencers, etc.
